# Epic 5: Timeline Composition Playback - Retrospective

**Epic Completed:** 2025-10-30
**Status:** ✅ Successfully Delivered

---

## Executive Summary

Epic 5 delivered a robust **Full Timeline Pre-Render Architecture** that enables seamless playback and export of multi-track timelines with clips positioned at arbitrary timeline locations. The architecture evolution from a complex hybrid segment-based approach to a simpler time-based overlay approach resulted in a more maintainable, performant, and reliable system.

## Key Achievements

### 1. **Full Timeline Pre-Render Architecture**
- **TimelineRenderer Service**: Renders entire timeline to single MP4 file using FFmpeg time-based overlay
- **Time-Based Overlay**: Black background for full duration + clips overlaid at exact positions using `enable='between(t,start,end)'`
- **Hash-Based Caching**: Automatically caches rendered timelines, invalidates on timeline changes
- **Cache Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup on app exit to prevent cache bloat

### 2. **Preview Playback**
- **MPV Integration**: Plays pre-rendered timeline file with 1:1 time mapping (no offsets needed)
- **Performance Optimization**: 30fps preview with throttled polling (50% reduction in overhead)
- **Smooth Playback**: No gaps, stuttering, or clip boundary issues
- **Timeline Duration Display**: Shows full timeline duration (e.g., "00:00 / 00:38")

### 3. **Export Functionality**
- **VideoExporter Refactor**: Delegates to TimelineRenderer, then transcodes to export format
- **Code Reduction**: Eliminated 207 lines of complex concat logic
- **Multi-Track Support**: Works correctly with multiple video/audio tracks
- **Position Support**: Clips at any timeline position, black frames in gaps

### 4. **Architecture Evolution**
- **Pivot Decision**: Abandoned complex hybrid segment-based approach mid-epic
- **Simplified Design**: Time-based overlay is simpler and more reliable than concat
- **Code Reuse**: VideoExporter and VideoPlayer both use TimelineRenderer
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for timeline rendering logic

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture Pattern: Two-Step Rendering
```
Timeline → TimelineRenderer → Temp MP4 File → {MPV Player OR VideoExporter}
```

### FFmpeg Filter Complex (Time-Based Overlay)
```ffmpeg
# Step 1: Black background for full duration
color=black:s=1920x1080:d=16.66:r=30[bg];

# Step 2: Trim and scale clips
[0:v]trim=start=0:duration=5.041,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS,scale=...[t1c0];
[1:v]trim=start=0:duration=6.6,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS,scale=...[t1c1];

# Step 3: Overlay clips at timeline positions
[bg][t1c0]overlay=enable='between(t,0,5.041)':shortest=0[tmp0];
[tmp0][t1c1]overlay=enable='between(t,10.06,16.66)':shortest=0[vout]
```

### Performance Optimizations
- **Preview**: 5fps frame capture (200ms), 30fps time polling (33ms)
- **Frame Drop Threshold**: Increased from 33ms to 50ms
- **Caching**: Render once, play many times
- **Hardware Acceleration**: VideoToolbox on macOS

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Playback Stopped at Clip Boundaries
**Root Cause:** PreviewPanel was using old composition logic looking for clips at playhead position
**Solution:** Removed clip lookup, let VideoPlayer handle timeline rendering internally

### Challenge 2: Export Media Type Mismatch
**Root Cause:** VideoExporter using concat filter with incompatible audio processing
**Solution:** Refactored to use TimelineRenderer, eliminating duplicate rendering logic

### Challenge 3: Time-Based Overlay Implementation
**Root Cause:** Initial concat approach ignored clip.startTime positions
**Solution:** Complete rewrite to use `color=black` background + `enable` parameter for time-based visibility

### Challenge 4: Preview Performance
**Root Cause:** 60fps polling + 10fps frame capture caused frame drops
**Solution:** Reduced to 30fps polling + 5fps capture, 50% overhead reduction

## Key Files Modified

### Rust Backend
- `src-tauri/src/services/timeline_renderer.rs` - New TimelineRenderer with time-based overlay
- `src-tauri/src/services/ffmpeg/exporter.rs` - Refactored to use TimelineRenderer
- `src-tauri/src/services/performance_monitor.rs` - Adjusted frame drop threshold
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Added cache cleanup on exit

### Frontend
- `src/components/player/VideoPlayer.tsx` - Simplified to use pre-rendered timeline
- `src/components/layout/PreviewPanel.tsx` - Removed old composition logic
- `src/components/player/PlayerControls.tsx` - Fixed timeline duration display

## Lessons Learned

### ✅ What Went Well

1. **Architectural Pivot**: Mid-epic decision to abandon segment-based approach saved weeks of complexity
2. **Code Reuse**: TimelineRenderer used by both player and exporter eliminated duplication
3. **Incremental Testing**: Each story validated before moving to next
4. **Performance Focus**: Proactive optimization prevented future issues

### ⚠️ What Could Be Improved

1. **Initial Architecture**: Should have validated concat approach limitations earlier
2. **Documentation**: More inline comments on FFmpeg filter generation would help future developers
3. **Testing Strategy**: More integration tests for timeline rendering edge cases
4. **Cache Management**: Consider LRU eviction instead of full cleanup on exit

### 📚 Technical Insights

1. **FFmpeg Concat vs Overlay**: Concat concatenates clips sequentially; overlay respects timeline positions
2. **`enable` Parameter**: Critical for time-based visibility in FFmpeg overlays
3. **RequestAnimationFrame**: Not ideal for controlled polling; setTimeout gives better control
4. **Hash-Based Caching**: Simple JSON serialization provides effective cache keys

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Done)
- ✅ Cache cleanup on app exit
- ✅ Timeline duration display
- ✅ Export functionality verified
- ✅ Performance optimizations

### Future Enhancements (Deferred)
- **LRU Cache Eviction**: Instead of full cleanup, evict least recently used
- **Progress Granularity**: More frequent progress updates during rendering
- **Audio Fade Support**: Integrate audio fades from Story 3.10 into TimelineRenderer
- **Canvas Size Configuration**: Make 1920x1080 configurable per project

## Conclusion

Epic 5 successfully delivered a production-ready timeline composition playback system through thoughtful architecture evolution. The pivot from segment-based to full timeline pre-render proved to be the right decision, resulting in a simpler, more maintainable, and more performant solution.

The key insight: **Pre-rendering the entire timeline as a single file with time-based overlays is simpler and more reliable than real-time composition with segment management.**

**Epic Status:** ✅ Complete and Production-Ready
