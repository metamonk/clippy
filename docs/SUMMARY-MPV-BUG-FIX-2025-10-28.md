## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Critical MPV Dimension Retrieval Bug ✅

**Problem:** MPV video player failing to load videos with `MPV_ERROR_PROPERTY_UNAVAILABLE` (Raw(-10)) error, causing 10-second timeouts.

**Root Cause:**
- Initial configuration used `vo=libmpv` and `vo=gpu` which require GUI/render contexts
- These outputs don't work in headless environments
- VideoReconfig event never fired without render API setup

**Solution:**
- Switched to headless MPV configuration: `vo=null`, `force-window=no`, `audio=no`
- Simplified event handling to wait only for `FileLoaded` event
- Fixed UI layout with `min-h-0` and `overflow-hidden` for proper video containment

**Results:**
- ✅ All codecs (H.264, HEVC, ProRes, VP9) load successfully in <1 second
- ✅ No window popups or GUI artifacts
- ✅ Video playback controls visible and functional
- ✅ Play/pause working with spacebar shortcut

### 2. Comprehensive Documentation Updates ✅

Updated 5 key documentation files to maintain continuity:

#### A. Handoff Document (`docs/HANDOFF-PLAYBACK-MODE-DEBUG-2025-10-28.md`)
- Added Debug Session 1 with full resolution details
- Documented findings, solution, and status
- Listed all modified files with line numbers
- Status marked as ✅ RESOLVED

#### B. Story 1.4 (`docs/stories/1-4-video-preview-player-with-basic-controls.md`)
- Added "MPV Dimension Bug Resolution" section to Completion Notes
- Documented issue, root cause, solution, and results
- Referenced handoff document for full details

#### C. Technical Debt (`docs/TECHNICAL-DEBT.md`)
- ✅ Marked TD-001 (Playback Mode Switching) as RESOLVED
- ✅ Marked TD-002 (MPV Dimension Retrieval) as RESOLVED
- Added TD-003 (Missing Seek/Scrub) - Priority: Medium, Status: Pending
- Added TD-004 (Video Stops 1s Early) - Priority: Low, Status: Pending

#### D. Architecture (`docs/architecture.md`)
- Added "Update (2025-10-28): Headless MPV Configuration" to ADR-006
- Documented root cause, solution, and results
- Included code snippet showing headless configuration
- Added references to handoff and technical debt docs

## 📝 Code Changes Made

### Modified Files (2 total)

1. **`src-tauri/src/services/mpv_player.rs`**
   - Lines 21-33: Changed MPV config to headless (`vo=null`, `force-window=no`, `audio=no`)
   - Lines 40-81: Simplified `load_file()` to wait only for FileLoaded event
   - Lines 174-190: Simplified `get_width()` and `get_height()` (removed retry logic)

2. **`src/components/layout/PreviewPanel.tsx`**
   - Line 30: Added `overflow-hidden min-h-0` to video container
   - Lines 33-35: Added `flex-shrink-0` wrapper around PlayerControls

---

## 🐛 Known Issues (Non-Blocking)

### TD-003: Missing Seek/Scrub Functionality
**Priority:** Medium
**Impact:** Users cannot scrub through video or restart playback
**Solution:** Add progress bar slider to PlayerControls (est. 3 hours)
**Status:** Pending

### TD-004: Video Stops 1 Second Before End
**Priority:** Low
**Impact:** Video doesn't reach true end position (shows 0:04/0:05)
**Solution:** Investigate MPV duration vs time-pos, adjust keep-open behavior (est. 1 hour)
**Status:** Pending

---

## 📊 Testing Results

### MPV Codec Tests (All Passing ✅)
- **H.264** (test_h264.mp4): 1170x2532 - Loads in <1s
- **HEVC** (test_hevc.mp4): 1170x2532 - Loads in <1s
- **ProRes** (test_prores.mov): 1170x2532 - Loads in <1s (previously failing!)
- **VP9** (test_vp9.webm): 1170x2532 - Loads in <1s

### UI/UX Tests
- ✅ Video preview panel shows video correctly
- ✅ PlayerControls visible at bottom (not hidden by tall portrait videos)
- ✅ Play/pause button functional
- ✅ Spacebar keyboard shortcut works
- ✅ Time display shows current/duration
- ⚠️ Scrubbing not available (TD-003)
- ⚠️ Video stops 1s early (TD-004)

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Headless MPV Configuration**
   - `vo=null` is correct for headless/screenshot-based rendering
   - `vo=libmpv` requires render API, `vo=gpu` creates window
   - VideoReconfig event only fires with GUI contexts

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - FileLoaded event sufficient for headless operation
   - Don't wait for VideoReconfig with `vo=null`
   - Dimensions optional - FFmpeg already provides them during import

3. **Flexbox Layout Gotcha**
   - `min-h-0` critical for allowing flex items to shrink below content size
   - Without it, tall portrait videos push controls out of viewport
   - `flex-shrink-0` ensures controls never shrink
