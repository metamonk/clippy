# Development Handoff Document
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Session:** Story 1.3.5 MPV Integration + Story 1.8 Trim Bug Fixes

## Session Summary

This session completed Story 1.3.5 (MPV Integration) and fixed critical bugs in Story 1.8 (Trim Functionality).

## What Was Completed

### 1. Story 1.3.5: MPV Integration for Universal Codec Support ✅

**Implementation:**
- Integrated libmpv2 v5.0.1 (Rust bindings) for professional video playback
- Event-based architecture using MPV's `FileLoaded` event (not polling)
- Backend-only playback control via Tauri commands (no video frame rendering in MVP)
- Tested with 4 codecs: H.264 ✅, HEVC yuv420p ✅, VP9 ✅, ProRes ✅
- WebM format support added to media import

**Key Files Modified:**
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Added libmpv2 v5.0.1
- `src-tauri/src/services/mpv_player.rs` - NEW: MPV service wrapper
- `src-tauri/src/commands/mpv.rs` - NEW: Tauri commands for MPV control
- `src-tauri/src/commands/media.rs` - Added WebM validation
- `src/components/player/VideoPlayer.tsx` - Replaced Video.js with MPV Tauri commands
- `src/components/media-library/MediaImport.tsx` - Added WebM support

**Documentation Created:**
- `docs/stories/1-3-5-mpv-integration-professional-video-playback.md` - Complete story doc
- `docs/stories/1-3-5-mpv-integration-professional-video-playback.context.xml` - Context file
- `docs/sprint-change-proposal-2025-10-28.md` - Sprint change tracking
- Updated `docs/architecture.md` - Added ADR-006 for MPV decision
- Updated `docs/epics.md` - Marked Story 1.3.5 complete
- Updated Stories 1.4, 1.7, 1-3 to reflect MPV instead of Video.js

**Known Limitations:**
- HEVC yuvj420p pixel format not supported (use yuv420p via FFmpeg conversion)
- Video frame rendering deferred (MVP prototype scope - backend control only)

### 2. Story 1.8: Trim Functionality Bug Fixes ✅

**Critical Bugs Fixed:**

**Bug 1: Timeline Positioning**
- **Problem:** Left trim handle dragged right caused clip to shrink from wrong edge
- **Fix:** Calculate `adjustedStartTime = clip.startTime + clip.trimIn`
- **File:** `src/components/timeline/TimelineClip.tsx:71-74`

**Bug 2: Trim Handle Movement**
- **Problem:** Handles physically moved during drag, could move vertically
- **Fix:** Removed Konva `draggable`, implemented window-level mouse tracking
- **File:** `src/components/timeline/TimelineClip.tsx:93-167`

**Bug 3: Visual Artifacts**
- **Problem:** Grey "trimmed region overlays" created confusion
- **Fix:** Simplified rendering to show only visible clip portion
- **File:** `src/components/timeline/TimelineClip.tsx:169-246`

**Documentation Updated:**
- `docs/stories/1-8-basic-trim-functionality-with-in-out-points.md` - Added Implementation Notes section

## Current Project State

### Working Features (Epic 1 TRUE MVP)
- ✅ Video file import (MP4, MOV, WebM) with drag & drop
- ✅ Media library with thumbnails
- ✅ Timeline foundation (single track)
- ✅ MPV-based video player with universal codec support
- ✅ Timeline-playback synchronization
- ✅ Trim functionality (in/out points) - now working correctly
- ✅ FFmpeg video export with progress tracking
- ✅ Production build & macOS app packaging

### Known Behaviors (By Design)
- Clips cannot be repositioned horizontally on timeline (not in Epic 1 scope)
- No video frame rendering (MVP backend control only)
- Single track only (multi-track in later epics)

### Technology Stack
**Backend:**
- Tauri 2.x (Rust)
- libmpv2 v5.0.1 (video playback)
- FFmpeg (metadata extraction, thumbnails, export)

**Frontend:**
- React 19 + TypeScript
- Zustand (state management)
- Konva.js (timeline canvas)
- Tailwind CSS
- Sonner (toast notifications)

## Git Status

**Uncommitted Changes:**
```
Modified: 24 files (MPV integration + trim fixes)
New files: 8 files (MPV services, commands, docs, tests)
```

**Recommended Next Step:** Create commit for trim fixes:
```bash
git add src/components/timeline/TimelineClip.tsx
git add docs/stories/1-8-basic-trim-functionality-with-in-out-points.md
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve timeline clip trim handle bugs

- Fix timeline positioning when trimming from left
- Replace Konva draggable with window-level mouse tracking
- Simplify rendering (remove grey overlay artifacts)
- Handles now locked in place, horizontal-only movement

Closes Story 1.8 trim functionality bugs."
```

## For Next Developer

### To Continue Development:

1. **Environment Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/zeno/Projects/clippy/project
   npm install
   npm run tauri dev
   ```

2. **Key Documentation:**
   - `docs/PRD.md` - Product requirements
   - `docs/architecture.md` - Technical architecture + ADRs
   - `docs/epics.md` - Epic breakdown
   - `docs/stories/` - Individual story documentation
   - `docs/sprint-change-proposal-2025-10-28.md` - Recent changes

3. **MPV Integration Details:**
   - Backend: `src-tauri/src/services/mpv_player.rs`
   - Commands: `src-tauri/src/commands/mpv.rs`
   - Frontend: `src/components/player/VideoPlayer.tsx`
   - Docs: `docs/stories/1-3-5-mpv-integration-professional-video-playback.md`

4. **Trim Implementation:**
   - Component: `src/components/timeline/TimelineClip.tsx`
   - Key patterns:
     - Window-level mouse tracking (not Konva dragging)
     - Declarative handle positioning via `trimIn`/`trimOut`
     - Timeline position adjusted for left trim: `clip.startTime + clip.trimIn`

### Next Stories to Implement:

According to `docs/epics.md`, Epic 1 is complete. Next logical epics:

- **Epic 2: Audio Integration** (Stories 2.1-2.4)
- **Epic 3: Multi-Track Timeline** (Stories 3.1-3.4)

Check `docs/sprint-status.yaml` for current sprint planning.

## Questions to Ask User

Before proceeding with new work:
1. Should we create git commits for the MPV integration and trim fixes?
2. Which epic should we tackle next (Epic 2 or Epic 3)?
3. Are there any bugs or polish items to address before moving forward?

## Technical Debt / Future Work

- Add tests for MPV integration (currently manual testing only)
- Add tests for trim functionality (window-level mouse tracking pattern)
- Consider adding clip repositioning (horizontal movement) in Epic 2 or 3
- Video frame rendering deferred until later epic (currently backend-only)
- HEVC yuvj420p support (may require libmpv configuration or FFmpeg preprocessing)
