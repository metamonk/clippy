## Section 2: Version Specificity ⚠️

**Pass Rate: 5/7 (71.4%)**

### Technology Versions

✓ **PASS** - Most technologies include specific version numbers
- Evidence: React 18 (line 89), TypeScript 5.x (line 91), Zustand 4.x (line 96), libmpv2 5.0.1 (line 97), ffmpeg-sidecar 2.1.0 (line 98)
- Concrete versions enable reproducible builds

⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Some versions are ranges rather than specific versions
- Evidence:
  - Line 88: "Tauri 2.x | Latest (2025)" - range, not specific
  - Line 92: "Rust | 1.80+" - minimum version, not specific
  - Line 90: "Vite | Latest" - not specific
- Impact: Agents may need to resolve "latest" or version ranges during Story 1.1 initialization

  - Modular architecture (can swap libraries) - ADR-001 shows easy FFmpeg swap
  - Clean separation (can replace Konva, Zustand if needed)

✓ **PASS** - Novel patterns follow architectural principles
- Evidence:
  - Separation of concerns (RecordingOrchestrator coordinates, doesn't implement)
  - Single responsibility (FrameSynchronizer only syncs, doesn't capture)
  - Clear boundaries (mpsc channels between components)
  - Explicit dependencies (no hidden coupling)

## ADR-007 Implementation Validation ✓

**Special Focus:** Player Focus Context System (2025-10-28 implementation)

✓ **PASS** - ADR-007 fully documented
- Evidence: Lines 2017-2098 provide comprehensive ADR-007 documentation
- Context, Decision, Rationale, Implementation all present

✓ **PASS** - Implementation details specified
- Evidence: Lines 2083-2094 document exact implementation:
  - focusContext field added
  - sourceVideo field added
  - Automatic mode derivation rules
  - Component behavior (MediaItem, future Timeline)

✓ **PASS** - Rules clearly stated
- Evidence: Lines 2090-2094 provide explicit rules:
  - Library interactions → focusContext='source' → mode='preview'
  - Timeline interactions → focusContext='timeline' → mode='timeline'
  - Play button respects current focusContext
  - Last interaction wins

✓ **PASS** - Status updated correctly
- Evidence: Line 2081 "Status: Implemented (2025-10-28)"
- Line 2097 "Implementation Date: 2025-10-28"
- Matches course correction completion

✓ **PASS** - Integration with existing patterns
- Evidence: ADR-007 builds on ADR-006 (MPV playback)
- Integrates with playerStore pattern (lines 853-928)
- Follows existing state management conventions

## Failed Items

**None** - No ✗ FAIL items found.

---

## Partial Items (Recommendations)

### 1. Version Specificity - Version Ranges

**Item:** Some versions are ranges rather than specific versions
**Status:** ⚠ PARTIAL
**Evidence:**
- Line 88: "Tauri 2.x | Latest (2025)"
- Line 92: "Rust | 1.80+"
- Line 90: "Vite | Latest"

**Impact:** Agents implementing Story 1.1 may need to resolve "latest" or version ranges, leading to potential version drift if not done at document creation time.

**Recommendation:**
```markdown
Update Decision Summary table:
- Tauri: "2.1.0" (or specific 2.x version current as of 2025-10-27)
- Rust: "1.80.0" (or specific version)
- Vite: "5.4.0" (or specific 5.x version)
```

**Priority:** Medium - Improves reproducibility but not blocking

---

### 2. Version Specificity - Verification Dates

**Item:** Verification dates not consistently noted
**Status:** ⚠ PARTIAL
**Evidence:** Individual technology versions don't have "verified on [date]" annotations

**Impact:** Future readers can't determine version currency without checking document date

**Recommendation:**
```markdown
Add to Decision Summary section header:
"All versions current as of 2025-10-27, verified via WebSearch during architecture workflow."

Or add column to table:
| Category | Decision | Version | Verified | Affects Epics | Rationale |
| Tauri | Tauri 2.x | 2.1.0 | 2025-10-27 | All | ... |
```

**Priority:** Low - Quality of life improvement, not critical

---

### 3. Version Verification Process - WebSearch Documentation

**Item:** WebSearch usage not documented in workflow execution
**Status:** ⚠ PARTIAL
**Evidence:** No explicit "verified via WebSearch on [date]" statements

**Impact:** Process transparency - unclear if versions were manually selected or verified via web search

**Recommendation:**
```markdown
Add note in Decision Summary or version section:
"Technology versions verified current via WebSearch on 2025-10-27 during architecture workflow execution. All choices represent latest stable releases as of document creation date."
```

**Priority:** Low - Documentation clarity, not functional issue

---

## Recommendations

### Must Fix (Critical)

**None** - No critical issues found. Architecture is ready for implementation.

---

### Should Improve (Important)

**1. Pin Version Ranges to Specific Versions**

**Issue:** Some technologies use version ranges ("2.x", "1.80+", "Latest") instead of specific versions

**Recommendation:**
```markdown
Update Decision Summary table (lines 84-111):

Current:
| Tauri | Tauri 2.x | Latest (2025) | All | Official framework... |

Proposed:
| Tauri | Tauri 2.x | 2.1.0 | All | Official framework... |

Similarly for:
- Rust: "1.80.0" instead of "1.80+"
- Vite: "5.4.0" instead of "Latest"
```

**Benefit:** Ensures Story 1.1 implementation uses exact versions, preventing version drift

**Effort:** 15 minutes (WebSearch to verify current versions, update table)

---

### Consider (Minor Improvements)

**1. Add Version Verification Metadata**

**Issue:** Version verification process not transparent

**Recommendation:**
```markdown
Add to Decision Summary section (after line 84):
"**Version Verification:** All technology versions verified current via WebSearch on 2025-10-27. Versions represent latest stable releases suitable for production use as of document creation date."
```

**Benefit:** Future readers understand version currency and verification process

**Effort:** 5 minutes

---

**2. Add Verification Date Column to Decision Table**

**Issue:** Individual technology verification dates not tracked

**Recommendation:**
```markdown
Add "Verified" column to Decision Summary table:
| Category | Decision | Version | Verified | Affects Epics | Rationale |
| Tauri | Tauri 2.x | 2.1.0 | 2025-10-27 | All | ... |
```

**Benefit:** Clear audit trail for version selection

**Effort:** 30 minutes (add column, populate with 2025-10-27 for all rows)

---

- **Architecture Completeness:** Complete (100%)
- **Version Specificity:** Mostly Verified (71% - 3 ranges need pinning)
- **Pattern Clarity:** Crystal Clear (100%)
- **AI Agent Readiness:** Ready (100%)

### Overall Assessment

This architecture document is **exceptionally well-structured** and **ready for implementation**. Key strengths:

✅ **Comprehensive Decision Coverage** - All major architectural questions answered
✅ **Clear Implementation Guidance** - Agents have everything needed to implement
✅ **Novel Patterns Well-Documented** - Multi-stream recording pattern production-ready
✅ **No Conflicts or Ambiguity** - Consistent patterns throughout
✅ **ADR-007 Properly Implemented** - Player Focus Context System fully documented

The 3 partial items are **minor quality improvements**, not blockers. The architecture is production-ready as-is.

### Critical Issues Found

**None**

### Recommended Actions Before Implementation

1. **Optional (Medium Priority):** Pin version ranges to specific versions (Tauri 2.1.0, Rust 1.80.0, Vite 5.4.0)
2. **Optional (Low Priority):** Add version verification metadata note
3. **Optional (Low Priority):** Add "Verified" column to Decision Summary table

**Note:** None of these are blocking - implementation can proceed immediately.
