**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Session:** Story 1.4 Visual Rendering Implementation
**Status:** Architecture clarification needed before completion
**Next Agent:** Architecture + Implementation

---

## üéØ What Was Accomplished

### ‚úÖ MPV Visual Rendering Implementation (90% Complete)

**Backend (Rust):**
- Added `get_width()` and `get_height()` methods with retry logic (500ms timeout)
  - **Fix Applied:** MPV properties unavailable immediately after load, added 10x50ms retry
  - Location: `src-tauri/src/services/mpv_player.rs`
- Added `capture_frame()` method using MPV's `screenshot-to-file` command
  - Returns JPEG frames as base64-encoded data
  - Location: `src-tauri/src/services/mpv_player.rs`
- Created Tauri commands:
  - `mpv_get_video_dimensions` - Returns width/height
  - `mpv_capture_frame` - Returns base64 frame
  - Location: `src-tauri/src/commands/mpv.rs`
- Properly exported all commands in `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs`

**Frontend (React):**
- Updated `VideoPlayer.tsx` to use HTML canvas instead of status text
- Added frame capture loop at 15 FPS (~67ms intervals)
- Implemented base64 frame decoding and canvas rendering
- Canvas auto-sizes to match video dimensions
- Location: `src/components/player/VideoPlayer.tsx`

**Build Status:**
- ‚úÖ Application builds successfully
- ‚úÖ App launches (PID: 66694 at time of handoff)
- ‚úÖ Video frames render to canvas
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Dimension retry fix applied but not yet tested end-to-end

## üö® Critical Issue Discovered: Playback Mode Confusion

### The Problem

**User reported:** When clicking a video in the media library, it loads into the player but **doesn't play independently** - it's tied to timeline playhead movement.

**Root Cause:** The VideoPlayer component doesn't distinguish between two fundamentally different use cases:

1. **Preview Mode (Story 1.4):** Preview selected media file independently
   - User clicks video in library ‚Üí wants to watch it
   - Should play **independent** of timeline
   - **Current behavior:** Timeline controls playback (wrong!)

2. **Timeline Mode (Story 1.7):** Play timeline composition
   - User clicks play with clips on timeline ‚Üí wants to watch edit
   - Should play **synchronized** with timeline
   - **Current behavior:** This is what's implemented (but applied incorrectly)

### Why This Matters

**Story 1.4 AC #2:** "Video plays when selected from media library"
- **Intent:** User should be able to preview videos before adding to timeline
- **Current:** Player is always synchronized with timeline, even when no clips exist
- **Impact:** UX is broken - can't preview videos independently

## üèóÔ∏è Recommended Architecture: Mode-Aware Single MPV

### Industry Pattern: "Source Monitor vs Program Monitor"

Professional video editors (Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro) use:
- **Source Monitor** = Preview selected media (Preview Mode)
- **Program Monitor** = Play timeline composition (Timeline Mode)
- **Shared Playback Engine** = Single backend switches between sources

### Proposed Implementation

**Store Architecture:**
```typescript
playerStore: {
  mode: 'preview' | 'timeline',          // Which component controls MPV
  previewVideo: MediaFile | null,        // Preview mode source
  timelinePlayhead: number,              // Timeline mode position
  isPlaying: boolean,                    // Shared playback state
  currentTime: number,                   // Current position
  duration: number,                      // Current duration
}
```

**Component Separation:**
```typescript
// Preview Mode Component
<PreviewPanel>
  <VideoPlayer mode="preview" />       {/* Shows previewVideo */}
  <PlayerControls />                   {/* Controls for preview */}
</PreviewPanel>

// Timeline Mode (Future - Story 1.7)
<Timeline>
  <TimelinePlayer mode="timeline" />   {/* Plays composition */}
</Timeline>
```

**Mode Switching Logic:**
- Click media library item ‚Üí `mode = 'preview'`, load video
- Click timeline play ‚Üí `mode = 'timeline'`, play composition
- Only one mode active at a time (single MPV instance)

### Why Single MPV Instance?

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Resource efficient (libmpv is heavyweight ~200MB RAM)
- ‚úÖ Only one can render audio/video at a time anyway
- ‚úÖ Clean switching between sources
- ‚úÖ Simpler state management

**Alternatives Rejected:**
- ‚ùå Two MPV instances = 2x memory, coordination complexity
- ‚ùå Conditional logic in one component = tangled, hard to maintain

## üìã Required Documentation Updates

### 1. Architecture Document (`docs/architecture.md`)

**Add Section:** ADR-007: Playback Mode Architecture

```markdown
## ADR-007: Playback Mode Architecture (Preview vs Timeline)

**Context:**
Video editor requires two distinct playback modes:
1. Preview Mode: Play selected media files independently
2. Timeline Mode: Play assembled timeline composition

**Decision:**
Implement mode-aware architecture with single MPV backend:
- playerStore tracks active mode ('preview' | 'timeline')
- VideoPlayer component for preview mode
- Future TimelinePlayer component for timeline mode
- Single MpvPlayerState in Tauri backend

**Rationale:**
- Follows industry pattern (Source Monitor / Program Monitor)
- Resource efficient (single libmpv instance)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Matches user mental model

**Implementation:**
- Story 1.4: Preview mode complete
- Story 1.7: Timeline mode implementation
```

### 2. PRD Document (`docs/PRD.md`)

**Update FR006:** Clarify two playback modes

```markdown
**FR006: Real-Time Video Preview and Playback**
- System shall provide **Preview Mode** for playing selected media files independently with basic controls (play/pause, seek, scrub)
- System shall provide **Timeline Mode** for rendering multi-track composition with PiP overlays in real-time preview window
- System shall use single MPV (libmpv) playback engine with mode switching for resource efficiency
- System shall maintain 30+ FPS playback and frame-accurate seeking (<33ms precision) in both modes
```

### 3. Story 1.4 (`docs/stories/1-4-video-preview-player-with-basic-controls.md`)

**Update Status and Add Implementation Note:**

```markdown
Status: in-progress

**ARCHITECTURE NOTE:** This story implements Preview Mode playback. Timeline Mode playback (Story 1.7) will use the same MPV backend with mode switching. See ADR-007 for full architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ~~HTML5 video element renders in preview area~~ **MPV backend provides playback control with visual rendering** (updated)
2. Video plays **independently** when selected from media library (Preview Mode)
3. Play/pause button controls preview playback
4. Video displays at appropriate resolution within preview window (canvas-based rendering)
5. Audio plays synchronized with video
6. Current time and duration displayed

**Mode:** Preview Mode (independent of timeline)
```

### 4. Story 1.7 (`docs/stories/1-7-timeline-playback-synchronization.md`)

**Add Architecture Reference:**

```markdown
**ARCHITECTURE NOTE:** This story implements Timeline Mode playback, which shares the MPV backend with Preview Mode (Story 1.4). Mode switching logic will be added to playerStore. See ADR-007 for full architecture.
```

### 5. Create New Technical Debt Item

**File:** `docs/TECHNICAL-DEBT.md` (create if doesn't exist)

```markdown
## TD-001: Implement Playback Mode Switching

**Priority:** High
**Discovered:** 2025-10-28 during Story 1.4 implementation
**Impact:** UX - users cannot preview videos independently

**Description:**
VideoPlayer currently always synchronizes with timeline, preventing independent preview of media library videos. Need to implement mode-aware architecture with 'preview' | 'timeline' modes.

**Solution:**
See ADR-007 in architecture.md for full design.

**Effort:** ~2 hours
**Stories Affected:** 1.4 (partial), 1.7 (blocks proper implementation)
```

## üéØ Next Steps for Implementing Agent

### Step 1: Update Documentation (30 minutes)

Execute updates listed in "Required Documentation Updates" section above:
1. Add ADR-007 to `docs/architecture.md`
2. Update FR006 in `docs/PRD.md`
3. Update Story 1.4 acceptance criteria and notes
4. Add architecture note to Story 1.7
5. Create or update `docs/TECHNICAL-DEBT.md`

### Step 2: Implement Mode-Aware Architecture (60 minutes)

**A. Update playerStore (`src/stores/playerStore.ts`):**

```typescript
interface PlayerStore {
  // Add mode field
  mode: 'preview' | 'timeline';

  // Existing fields
  currentVideo: MediaFile | null;
  isPlaying: boolean;
  currentTime: number;
  duration: number;
  playheadPosition: number;

  // Add mode switching action
  setMode: (mode: 'preview' | 'timeline') => void;

  // Existing actions...
}

export const usePlayerStore = create<PlayerStore>()(
  devtools(
    (set, get) => ({
      mode: 'preview',  // Default to preview mode
      // ... existing state

      setMode: (mode) => set({ mode }),

      // ... existing actions
    }),
    { name: 'PlayerStore' }
  )
);
```

**B. Update MediaItem.tsx (`src/components/media-library/MediaItem.tsx`):**

```typescript
const handleClick = () => {
  // Set to preview mode when selecting from library
  usePlayerStore.getState().setMode('preview');
  setCurrentVideo(file);
};
```

**C. Update VideoPlayer.tsx (`src/components/player/VideoPlayer.tsx`):**

Add mode check to prevent timeline interference:

```typescript
// Only sync with timeline if in timeline mode
useEffect(() => {
  const { mode } = usePlayerStore.getState();
  if (mode !== 'timeline') return; // Skip timeline sync in preview mode

  // Existing timeline synchronization code...
}, [playheadPosition, selectedClip, videoLoaded]);
```

**D. Update Timeline play button (when implemented):**

```typescript
const handleTimelinePlay = () => {
  usePlayerStore.getState().setMode('timeline');
  usePlayerStore.getState().play();
};
```

### Step 3: Test Both Modes (20 minutes)

**Preview Mode Test:**
1. Import video to media library
2. Click video in library
3. Click play button
4. **Expected:** Video plays independently, timeline doesn't move
5. **Expected:** Can seek/pause/play without timeline interaction

**Timeline Mode Test (when clips exist):**
1. Drag clip to timeline
2. Click timeline play button
3. **Expected:** Playhead moves, video syncs with timeline
4. **Expected:** Timeline controls playback

### Step 4: Complete Story 1.4 (10 minutes)

1. Mark all tasks complete in story file
2. Update sprint-status.yaml: `in-progress` ‚Üí `review`
3. Run test suite: `npm test`
4. Document any remaining issues

## üêõ Known Issues

### 1. MPV Dimension Retrieval Timing (FIXED)
- **Issue:** `get_width`/`get_height` failed with Raw(-10) = MPV_ERROR_PROPERTY_UNAVAILABLE
- **Cause:** Properties not available until first frame decoded
- **Fix:** Added retry logic (10 attempts √ó 50ms = 500ms max)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Fix applied, needs testing

### 2. Playback Mode Confusion (OPEN)
- **Issue:** VideoPlayer always syncs with timeline, can't preview independently
- **Cause:** No mode distinction in architecture
- **Fix:** Implement mode-aware architecture (documented above)
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires implementation (next agent)

### 3. Frame Capture Performance
- **Issue:** 15 FPS may be low for smooth playback
- **Impact:** Slight choppiness visible during fast motion
- **Potential Fix:** Increase to 30 FPS (33ms intervals) or use MPV render callbacks
- **Status:** üìù Future optimization (not blocking)

1. **Start with documentation** - Update arch docs before coding
2. **Test dimension fix first** - Verify retry logic works with real video
3. **Implement mode switching** - Follow architecture plan above
4. **Keep it simple** - Don't over-engineer, single MPV instance is correct
5. **Test both modes** - Verify preview AND timeline (when clips exist)
