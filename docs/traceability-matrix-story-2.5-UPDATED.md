---

### GATE DECISION: ⚠️ **CONCERNS**

---

### Rationale

**Why CONCERNS (not PASS):**

1. **P0 Coverage at 75% (100% required)**
   - AC#4 (notifications): PARTIAL coverage (integration tests passing, manual verification needed)
   - AC#10 (disk exhaustion): PARTIAL coverage (pre-check + warning tested, periodic monitoring needs E2E)
   - **Impact:** One P0 criterion (AC#10 periodic monitoring) not fully validated

2. **P1 Coverage at 50% (90% required)**
   - 3 FULL + 3 PARTIAL out of 6 criteria
   - AC#6 (cancel recording) has NO automated tests (implementation exists, untested)
   - **Impact:** Cancel recording feature not validated (regression risk)

3. **Overall Coverage at 50% (80% required)**
   - 5 FULL + 5 PARTIAL out of 10 criteria
   - Missing E2E tests for full workflow validation
   - **Impact:** End-to-end user journeys not validated

**Why CONCERNS (not FAIL):**

- All 3 original P0 blockers RESOLVED (Hook errors, AC#4 partial, AC#10 partial)
- P0 Test Pass Rate: 100% (all integration tests passing)
- P1 Test Pass Rate: 100% (all unit/component tests passing)
- Overall Test Pass Rate: 100% (no failing tests)
- Security: PASS, NFRs: mostly PASS

**Why CONCERNS (not WAIVED):**

- P0 gap (AC#10 periodic monitoring) could be waived with manual test plan
- P1 gap (AC#6 cancel recording) should have at least unit test before deployment
- No business justification provided yet for waiving E2E tests

**Recommendation:**

- **ALLOW deployment with CONDITIONS** ⚠️
- **Conditions:**
  1. Manual test AC#10 periodic disk space monitoring during 5+ minute recording
  2. Add `2.5-UNIT-020` for cmd_cancel_recording (P1, 15-20 min effort)
  3. Document AC#5 pause/resume MVP limitation in README (Action Item #10)
- **Alternative:** Add `2.5-E2E-004` for AC#10 periodic monitoring (P0, 20-30 min effort) → achieves PASS decision

---

### Residual Risks (For CONCERNS)

**Recommended actions before deployment:**

1. **AC#10: Periodic disk space monitoring (P0 gap)**
   - **Priority**: P0 (recommended manual test OR E2E test)
   - **Probability**: Low (disk fills up during recording)
   - **Impact**: Critical (data loss - partial recordings lost)
   - **Risk Score**: 9 (Low × Critical = 9)
   - **Mitigation**: Manual test OR add `2.5-E2E-004`
   - **Remediation**: 30-minute recording session with disk space monitoring validation

2. **AC#4: Native macOS notification manual verification**
   - **Priority**: P0 (manual test required)
   - **Probability**: Medium (notification may fail silently)
   - **Impact**: Medium (users unaware recording started, but recording succeeds)
   - **Risk Score**: 4 (Medium × Medium = 4)
   - **Mitigation**: Integration tests verify command called, graceful failure tested
   - **Remediation**: Manual test on macOS to verify native notification appears

3. **AC#6: Cancel recording untested**
   - **Priority**: P1 (recommended unit test)
   - **Probability**: Medium (partial file not deleted)
   - **Impact**: Low (disk space wasted, user confusion)
   - **Risk Score**: 2 (Medium × Low = 2)
   - **Mitigation**: Implementation reviewed in Senior Developer Review
   - **Remediation**: Add `2.5-UNIT-020` (Rust unit test for file deletion + task abort)

**Overall Residual Risk**: **MEDIUM** ⚠️ (DOWN from CRITICAL)

**Deployment Status:** **CONDITIONAL APPROVAL** ⚠️ (requires manual tests OR additional E2E test)

6. **Re-Run Gate After Manual Tests Complete**
   - Update traceability matrix with manual test results
   - Re-run `bmad tea *trace` workflow
   - Expected decision: **PASS** (if manual tests pass)
   - Target: 2025-10-30 (after manual tests complete)

---

### Next Steps

**Immediate Actions** (next 24 hours):

1. ✅ Deploy to staging/QA environment (conditional approval granted)
2. Conduct 2 manual tests (AC#10 periodic monitoring, AC#4 notifications)
3. **OPTIONAL:** Add `2.5-E2E-004` (alternative to manual tests)

**Follow-up Actions** (next 48 hours):

4. Add `2.5-UNIT-020` (AC#6 - cancel recording unit test)
5. Document AC#5 pause/resume limitation in README
6. Re-run gate decision after manual tests complete

**Stakeholder Communication**:

- Notify PM: **Story 2.5 CONDITIONALLY APPROVED** - 2 P0 manual tests required before production
- Notify SM: **Staging deployment APPROVED** - Production deployment pending manual test results
- Notify QA lead: **Manual test plan provided** - AC#10 (periodic monitoring) + AC#4 (notifications)
- Notify DEV lead: **Significant improvement** - 0% → 50% coverage, all P0 blockers resolved
