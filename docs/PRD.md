# clippy Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Author:** zeno
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Project Level:** 2
**Target Scale:** Learning project + functional tool (6-7 month timeline for complete feature set)

---

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Master Tauri architecture and Rust fundamentals through building a production-quality macOS desktop application with native API integration (AVFoundation, ScreenCaptureKit)
- Create a genuinely useful video editing tool with screen recording, multi-track timeline editing, and AI-powered transcription/captioning that reduces manual captioning time by 80%+
- Build a portfolio-worthy demonstration of full-stack desktop development integrating native macOS capabilities, complex media processing, and AI services

### Background Context

Developers learning modern desktop application development face a critical gap: existing Tauri resources focus on toy examples rather than real-world applications integrating native OS capabilities, complex media processing, and AI services. Meanwhile, content creators producing video content face tedious manual workflows for accessibilityâ€”manual transcription and captioning costs 4-8 hours per hour of video, with professional services costing $1-3 per minute.

clippy bridges both gaps as a macOS-native video editor built with Tauri that combines intermediate editing capabilities with AI-powered workflow automation. It serves dual purposes: a learning vehicle for mastering Tauri + Rust + native macOS integration, and a functional tool that delivers AI-first accessibility features (automatic transcription, caption generation via OpenAI) within a lightweight, native editor. This positions clippy as both a reference implementation for the Tauri community and a practical solution for video editing with automated captioning workflows.

## User Journeys

_User journeys skipped for this Level 2 project. Primary workflows are captured in functional requirements and will be detailed in story acceptance criteria._

## UX Design Principles

1. **Native macOS Experience** - Follow macOS Human Interface Guidelines for menus, window chrome, keyboard shortcuts, and interactions to feel like a natural part of the macOS ecosystem
2. **Transparent Workflow** - Users should clearly understand recording state, editing actions, and AI processing status with real-time feedback and progress indicators
3. **Efficient Timeline Editing** - Prioritize keyboard shortcuts, drag-drop interactions, and snap-to-grid precision for fast, professional-feeling editing workflows
4. **Graceful AI Integration** - AI features (transcription, captions) enhance workflow without blocking core editing; offline mode allows editing even when AI services unavailable

---

## User Interface Design Goals

**Target Platform:**

- **Recording Control Panel:** Overlay/modal for configuring and controlling screen/webcam recording
- **AI Workflow Panel:** Side panel for transcription display, caption editing, and content analysis results
- **Export Configuration:** Modal dialog for export settings and progress

**Key Interaction Patterns:**
- **Drag & Drop:** Primary method for importing files and arranging clips on timeline
- **Canvas-based Timeline:** HTML5 Canvas with Fabric.js for responsive, smooth timeline manipulation
- **Native Controls:** macOS-standard file dialogs, keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+Z for undo, Space for play/pause, etc.)
- **Real-time Preview:** Video player updates immediately as playhead moves or clips are adjusted

**Design Constraints:**
- **UI Framework:** React 18+ with Tailwind CSS for rapid styling
- **Video Player:** HTML5 video element enhanced with Video.js for professional controls
- **Timeline Rendering:** Fabric.js on HTML5 Canvas for drag-drop timeline UI
- **Browser Support:** WebView2 (system WebKit on macOS) - no cross-browser concerns
