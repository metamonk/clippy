### Detailed Mapping

#### AC-1: Recording panel/modal with clear "Start Recording" and "Stop Recording" buttons (P1)

- **Coverage:** PARTIAL ⚠️
- **Tests:**
  - `RecordingPanel.test.tsx:74-82` - "should show 'Record Screen' button when idle"
    - **Given:** User opens recording panel
    - **When:** Panel is in idle state
    - **Then:** "Record Screen" button is visible
    - **Status:** FAILING (Hook errors)
  - `RecordingPanel.test.tsx:84-108` - "should start recording when 'Record Screen' clicked"
    - **Given:** Permission granted
    - **When:** User clicks "Record Screen"
    - **Then:** Recording starts, toast notification shown
    - **Status:** FAILING (Hook errors)
  - `RecordingPanel.test.tsx:154-210` - "should stop recording and auto-import to media library"
    - **Given:** Recording is active
    - **When:** User clicks "Stop Recording"
    - **Then:** Recording stops, file imported to media library
    - **Status:** FAILING (Hook errors)

- **Gaps:**
  - ❌ All component tests FAILING due to Hook errors (React version mismatch or hook usage issue)
  - ❌ No E2E test validating full UI workflow
  - ❌ UI implementation exists (RecordingControls.tsx:36-45, 104-113) but untested

- **Recommendation:** Fix Hook errors in RecordingPanel.test.tsx to enable component test execution. Add E2E test: `2.5-E2E-001` (P1) for complete recording controls workflow.

---

#### AC-2: Recording duration timer shows elapsed time (P1)

- **Coverage:** PARTIAL ⚠️
- **Tests:**
  - `recordingStore.test.ts:134-144` - "updateElapsedTime"
    - **Given:** Recording store initialized
    - **When:** updateElapsedTime called with 5000ms
    - **Then:** elapsedMs state updated to 5000
    - **Status:** PASSING ✅
  - `RecordingPanel.test.tsx:132-152` - "should show duration timer when recording"
    - **Given:** Recording started
    - **When:** Timer updates
    - **Then:** Timer displays 00:00 format
    - **Status:** FAILING (Hook errors)

- **Gaps:**
  - ❌ Component test FAILING (Hook errors)
  - ❌ No test verifying MM:SS format correctness beyond 00:00
  - ❌ No test verifying timer updates every 100ms (Finding L1: timer interval 100ms, may need optimization)
  - ✅ Store unit test passes (basic state management validated)

- **Recommendation:** Fix component tests. Add unit test for formatTime() utility. Consider E2E test validating timer counts up during recording (e.g., 00:00 → 00:05 after 5 seconds).

---

#### AC-3: Visual indicator (pulsing red dot) shows recording is active (P1)

- **Coverage:** PARTIAL ⚠️
- **Tests:**
  - `RecordingPanel.test.tsx:110-130` - "should show recording indicator when recording"
    - **Given:** Recording started
    - **When:** Recording active
    - **Then:** "Recording..." text and indicator visible
    - **Status:** FAILING (Hook errors)

- **Gaps:**
  - ❌ Component test FAILING (Hook errors)
  - ❌ No test verifying CSS animation (animate-ping) is applied
  - ❌ No visual regression test for pulsing red dot appearance
  - ✅ Implementation exists (RecordingControls.tsx:51-66)

- **Recommendation:** Fix component tests. Add visual regression test or snapshot test for pulsing indicator. Consider E2E test with screenshot validation (optional).

---

#### AC-4: Native macOS notification when recording starts (P0)

- **Coverage:** NONE ❌
- **Implementation:**
  - `cmd_send_recording_notification` (recording.rs:284-304)
  - tauri-plugin-notification integrated
  - RecordingPanel.tsx calls notification on recording start

- **Gaps:**
  - ❌ NO automated tests (unit, integration, or E2E)
  - ❌ Manual testing mentioned in Dev Notes (line 111) but not validated
  - ⚠️ Notification permission handling not tested (graceful error handling exists: lines 297-300)

- **Recommendation:** Add integration test: `2.5-INT-001` (P0) mocking tauri-plugin-notification to verify notification sent on recording start. Manual test on macOS to verify native notification appears. Document in test execution results.

---

#### AC-5: Pause/resume functionality for screen recording (P1)

- **Coverage:** PARTIAL (MVP placeholders) ⚠️
- **Tests:**
  - `recordingStore.test.ts` - Pause/resume state management (tests exist for store actions)
    - **Status:** PASSING ✅ (frontend state only)
  - Backend commands: `cmd_pause_recording`, `cmd_resume_recording` (recording.rs:311-328)
    - **Status:** Placeholders (no-ops), no tests

- **Gaps:**
  - ⚠️ Finding M1: Pause/resume are frontend-only placeholders (backend commands return Ok(()) without pausing ScreenCaptureKit or FFmpeg)
  - ❌ No tests validating pause stops capture (because it doesn't - MVP limitation)
  - ❌ No E2E test for pause → resume workflow
  - ✅ Frontend state management tested (recordingStore)

- **Recommendation:** Accept as MVP limitation (documented in Dev Notes line 204 and Review Finding M1). For full implementation, add integration test validating ScreenCaptureKit pause and FFmpeg restart. Current status: PASS (MVP scope) but NOT production-ready pause/resume.

---

#### AC-6: Can cancel recording (discards partial recording) (P1)

- **Coverage:** NONE ❌
- **Implementation:**
  - `cmd_cancel_recording` (recording.rs:334-375)
  - Aborts capture/writer tasks, deletes partial file
  - RecordingPanel.tsx includes cancel button

- **Gaps:**
  - ❌ NO frontend tests for cancel button interaction
  - ❌ NO backend tests for cmd_cancel_recording (file deletion, task abort)
  - ❌ NO E2E test for cancel workflow
  - ⚠️ Implementation exists but untested (high risk for regressions)

- **Recommendation:** Add unit test: `2.5-UNIT-020` (P1) for cmd_cancel_recording (mock file deletion, verify task abort). Add E2E test: `2.5-E2E-002` (P1) for cancel workflow (start recording → cancel → verify no file created).

---

#### AC-7: Recording controls remain accessible during recording (P1)

- **Coverage:** PARTIAL ⚠️
- **Tests:**
  - `RecordingPanel.test.tsx` - Tests controls in recording/paused/stopping states
    - **Status:** FAILING (Hook errors)

- **Gaps:**
  - ❌ Component tests FAILING (Hook errors)
  - ❌ No test validating controls enabled/disabled logic during state transitions
  - ❌ No E2E test confirming all buttons (pause/resume/cancel/stop) remain clickable during recording

- **Recommendation:** Fix component tests. Add E2E test verifying all recording state transitions (idle → recording → paused → recording → stopping → idle) with controls accessible at each step.

---

#### AC-8: Check available disk space before starting recording (P2)

- **Coverage:** PARTIAL ⚠️
- **Implementation:**
  - `cmd_check_disk_space` (recording.rs:381-414) - Uses unsafe libc::statfs
  - RecordingPanel.tsx:149-165 - Pre-recording disk space check

- **Tests:**
  - `RecordingPanel.test.tsx` - Mocks disk space check (5GB available)
    - **Status:** FAILING (Hook errors)

- **Gaps:**
  - ❌ Component test FAILING (Hook errors)
  - ❌ NO unit test for cmd_check_disk_space (unsafe code block untested - Finding L2)
  - ❌ NO test validating 5MB/min estimation calculation (150MB for 30-min recording)
  - ⚠️ Using unsafe libc::statfs instead of safer abstraction (sysinfo crate)

- **Recommendation:** Add unit test: `2.5-UNIT-021` (P2) for cmd_check_disk_space (test with different available space values). Add test validating estimation calculation. Consider refactoring to use sysinfo crate (Finding L2 from Review).

---

#### AC-9: Display warning if available space < estimated file size (assume 5MB/min for estimation) (P2)

- **Coverage:** PARTIAL ⚠️
- **Implementation:**
  - RecordingPanel.tsx:154-165 - Warning if space < 150MB (30-min estimate)
  - RecordingPanel.tsx:109-113 - Warning toast notification

- **Tests:**
  - `RecordingPanel.test.tsx` - Includes disk space warning logic in mock setup
    - **Status:** FAILING (Hook errors)

- **Gaps:**
  - ❌ Component test FAILING (Hook errors)
  - ❌ NO test with low disk space scenario (e.g., 100MB available → warning shown)
  - ❌ NO test validating 5MB/min estimation formula is correct
  - ❌ NO E2E test showing warning toast appears before recording starts

- **Recommendation:** Fix component tests. Add test case with low disk space (100MB) → verify warning toast appears with correct message. Add E2E test: `2.5-E2E-003` (P2) for disk space warning flow.

---

#### AC-10: Stop recording gracefully if disk space exhausted with partial file save notification (P0)

- **Coverage:** NONE ❌
- **Implementation:**
  - RecordingPanel.tsx:100-108 - Periodic monitoring every 30s, stop at <50MB
  - Toast notification for partial file save

- **Gaps:**
  - ❌ NO automated tests (unit, integration, or E2E)
  - ❌ NO test simulating disk space exhaustion during recording
  - ❌ NO test validating periodic monitoring (every 30s)
  - ❌ NO test confirming partial file is saved (not discarded)
  - ⚠️ P0 criterion with ZERO test coverage (CRITICAL GAP)

- **Recommendation:** Add integration test: `2.5-INT-002` (P0) mocking disk space depletion during recording → verify graceful stop and partial file save. Add E2E test: `2.5-E2E-004` (P0) for disk space exhaustion scenario (may require mocking file system).

---

### Gap Analysis

#### Critical Gaps (BLOCKER) ❌

**3 P0 criteria with insufficient coverage:**

1. **AC-4: Native macOS notification**
   - Current Coverage: NONE
   - Missing Tests: Integration test for notification sending
   - Recommend: `2.5-INT-001` (integration test mocking tauri-plugin-notification)
   - Impact: Users may not know recording started if notification fails silently

2. **AC-10: Graceful stop on disk space exhaustion**
   - Current Coverage: NONE

   - Missing: Low disk space scenario test, toast validation
   - Recommend: `2.5-E2E-003` (P2) with low disk space mock

---

#### Low Priority Gaps (Optional) ℹ️

**No P3 criteria** - All criteria are P0-P2 for recording controls.

---

### Quality Assessment

#### Tests with Issues

**BLOCKER Issues** ❌

- **RecordingPanel.test.tsx** - ALL tests failing with Hook errors
  - **Issue:** "Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component."
  - **Impact:** 10 component tests unable to execute (AC#1, #2, #3, #7, #8, #9)
  - **Remediation:** Fix React Hook usage or version mismatch. May need to update @testing-library/react or adjust component mocking strategy.
  - **Priority:** CRITICAL - Blocks all UI validation

- **cmd_check_disk_space (recording.rs:381-414)** - Unsafe libc::statfs usage (Finding L2)
  - **Issue:** Using unsafe FFI instead of safer Rust abstraction
  - **Impact:** Untested unsafe code block (memory safety risk)
  - **Remediation:** Add unit test or refactor to use sysinfo crate for cross-platform disk space queries
  - **Priority:** MEDIUM

**WARNING Issues** ⚠️

- **Timer interval 100ms (RecordingPanel.tsx:85)** - Inherited from Story 2.2 (Finding L1)
  - **Issue:** Timer updates every 100ms (10 re-renders/second) for MM:SS display (only needs 1-second precision)
  - **Impact:** Potential performance overhead
  - **Remediation:** Reduce to 1000ms interval or optimize rendering
  - **Priority:** LOW

- **Pause/resume MVP placeholders (Finding M1)** - Backend no-ops
  - **Issue:** cmd_pause_recording and cmd_resume_recording are no-ops (frontend state only)
  - **Impact:** Users see "paused" UI but recording continues in background (no resource savings, paused segments not omitted)
  - **Remediation:** Document as MVP limitation. Full implementation requires ScreenCaptureKit pause + FFmpeg restart.
  - **Priority:** MEDIUM (documented limitation, acceptable for MVP)

**INFO Issues** ℹ️

- **No E2E tests for Story 2.5** - Only unit/component tests (component tests failing)
  - **Issue:** Missing end-to-end validation of recording controls workflow
  - **Impact:** Cannot verify full user journey (start → pause → resume → cancel → stop)
  - **Remediation:** Add 4 E2E tests (2.5-E2E-001 through 2.5-E2E-004)
  - **Priority:** HIGH

---

#### Tests Passing Quality Gates

**5/108 tests (4.6%) related to Story 2.5 features passing** ⚠️

**Passing Tests:**
- recordingStore.test.ts: 27/27 tests ✅ (state management for pause/resume, audio, timer)
- Rust backend: 81/81 tests ✅ (permissions, FFmpeg, audio capture, frame sync)

**Failing Tests:**
- RecordingPanel.test.tsx: 0/10 tests ❌ (Hook errors)

**Missing Tests:**
- 0 E2E tests for Story 2.5
- 0 integration tests for notifications (AC#4)
- 0 integration tests for disk space monitoring (AC#10)
- 0 unit tests for cmd_cancel_recording (AC#6)
- 0 unit tests for cmd_check_disk_space (AC#8)

**Test Quality Rating:** ⭐⭐ (2/5 stars)
- Excellent backend unit test coverage (81 tests passing)
- Good store unit test coverage (27 tests passing)
- CRITICAL: All component tests failing (Hook errors)
- Missing: E2E, integration, and critical unit tests for P0/P1 features

---

### Coverage by Test Level

| Test Level | Tests | Criteria Covered           | Coverage % |
| ---------- | ----- | -------------------------- | ---------- |
| E2E        | 0     | 0/10                       | 0%         |
| API/INT    | 0     | 0/10 (notifications, disk) | 0%         |
| Component  | 0     | 0/10 (all failing)         | 0%         |
| Unit       | 108   | 2/10 (AC#2, AC#5 partial)  | 20%        |
| **Total**  | **108** | **2/10 partial**         | **10%**    |

**Critical Issue:** Zero E2E coverage, zero integration coverage, zero component coverage (all failing). Only unit-level coverage for state management and backend commands.

---

### Traceability Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions (BLOCKER - Before Deployment)

1. **Fix RecordingPanel.test.tsx Hook errors** (CRITICAL)
   - All 10 component tests failing due to "Invalid hook call" error
   - May be React version mismatch or improper hook mocking
   - Blocks validation of AC#1, #2, #3, #7, #8, #9

2. **Add integration test for macOS notifications (AC#4 - P0)**
   - Test ID: `2.5-INT-001`
   - Mock tauri-plugin-notification
   - Verify notification sent on recording start
   - Validate graceful error handling if notification fails

3. **Add integration test for disk space exhaustion (AC#10 - P0)**
   - Test ID: `2.5-INT-002`
   - Mock disk space depletion during recording

   - Update README.md and TECHNICAL-DEBT.md
   - Clarify that pause continues recording in background (frontend state only)
   - Document full implementation plan (ScreenCaptureKit pause + FFmpeg restart)

#### Long-term Actions (Backlog - Post Epic 2)

11. **Refactor cmd_check_disk_space to use sysinfo crate (Finding L2)**
   - Replace unsafe libc::statfs with safer cross-platform abstraction
   - Eliminates unsafe block (recording.rs:396-408)
   - Improves maintainability and cross-platform support

12. **Optimize timer interval from 100ms to 1000ms (Finding L1)**
   - Reduce re-renders from 10/second to 1/second
   - MM:SS format only needs 1-second precision
   - Improves performance (minor impact)

13. **Implement full pause/resume backend (Finding M1)**
   - Pause ScreenCaptureKit frame capture (SCStream.stopCapture())
   - Pause FFmpeg encoding (requires restart with same output file)
   - Handle timestamp discontinuity per Tech Spec Workflow 3
   - Add integration tests for pause/resume workflow

2. P0 Test Pass Rate at 0% (threshold: 100%) - No passing tests for P0 criteria
3. Critical NFR Failure: RecordingPanel.test.tsx Hook errors (reliability issue)

---

#### P1 Criteria (Required for PASS, May Accept for CONCERNS)

| Criterion              | Threshold | Actual | Status    |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ------ | --------- |
| P1 Coverage            | ≥90%      | 0%     | ❌ FAIL   |

**P1 Evaluation**: ❌ FAILED

**Failures:**
1. P1 Coverage at 0% (threshold: ≥90%) - No FULL coverage for any P1 criterion (AC#1, #2, #3, #5, #6, #7)
2. P1 Test Pass Rate at 25% (threshold: ≥95%) - Only recordingStore tests pass (27/108), component tests fail
3. Overall Coverage at 0% (threshold: ≥80%) - No criterion has FULL coverage status

**Note:** Overall Test Pass Rate appears as 100% because failing component tests (Hook errors) are excluded from the count. If included, pass rate would be 108/118 = 91%.

#### P2/P3 Criteria (Informational, Don't Block)

| Criterion         | Actual | Notes                    |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| P2 Test Pass Rate | 0%     | AC#8, #9 tests failing (Hook errors) |
| P3 Test Pass Rate | N/A    | No P3 criteria           |

---

### GATE DECISION: ❌ FAIL

---

### Rationale

**Why FAIL (not PASS):**

1. **P0 Coverage Incomplete (0% vs 100% required)**
   - AC#4 (native macOS notification) has ZERO automated tests ❌
   - AC#10 (disk space exhaustion graceful stop) has ZERO automated tests ❌
   - Both are CRITICAL user-facing features with no validation

2. **P0 Test Pass Rate at 0% (100% required)**
   - No passing tests for AC#4 or AC#10
   - Critical gaps in quality validation

3. **Critical NFR Failure: RecordingPanel.test.tsx Hook errors**
   - ALL 10 component tests failing (100% failure rate for UI validation) ❌
   - Blocks validation of AC#1, #2, #3, #7, #8, #9
   - Reliability issue: Cannot verify UI controls work correctly

4. **P1 Coverage at 0% (90% required)**
   - No FULL coverage for 6 P1 criteria (AC#1, #2, #3, #5, #6, #7)
   - Only PARTIAL coverage (implementation exists, tests incomplete/failing)

5. **Overall Coverage at 0% (80% required)**
   - Zero criteria have FULL coverage status
   - All 10 criteria are PARTIAL or NONE

**Why FAIL (not CONCERNS):**

- Multiple P0 blockers (AC#4, AC#10 untested)
- Critical NFR failure (component tests failing)
- P1 coverage far below threshold (0% vs 90%)
- Not a "minor gap" - systemic test coverage issue affecting all acceptance criteria

**Why FAIL (not WAIVED):**

- P0 gaps cannot be waived per workflow rules:
  - AC#4: Native macOS notification (user feedback critical for usability)
  - AC#10: Disk space exhaustion (data integrity risk - partial recordings may be lost)
- Critical NFR failure (Hook errors) indicates code quality issue, not acceptable risk
- No business justification provided for waiving test coverage

**Recommendation:**

- **BLOCK deployment immediately** ❌
- Fix RecordingPanel.test.tsx Hook errors (BLOCKER for all UI validation)
- Add 2 integration tests for P0 criteria (AC#4, AC#10): `2.5-INT-001`, `2.5-INT-002`
- Add 4 E2E tests for complete workflow validation: `2.5-E2E-001` through `2.5-E2E-004`
- Re-run `bmad tea *trace` workflow after tests added and passing
- Verify decision is PASS before deploying

---

### Residual Risks (For FAIL)

**Unresolved P0/P1 issues blocking release:**

1. **AC#4: Native macOS notification untested**
   - **Priority**: P0
   - **Probability**: Medium (notification may fail silently)
   - **Impact**: High (users unaware recording started)
   - **Risk Score**: 6 (Medium × High = 6)
   - **Mitigation**: Manual testing only (not acceptable for P0)
   - **Remediation**: Add `2.5-INT-001` integration test (mock tauri-plugin-notification)

2. **AC#10: Disk space exhaustion untested**
   - **Priority**: P0
   - **Probability**: Low (disk fills up during recording)
   - **Impact**: Critical (data loss - partial recordings lost)
   - **Risk Score**: 9 (Low × Critical = 9)
   - **Mitigation**: None (no automated validation)
   - **Remediation**: Add `2.5-INT-002` + `2.5-E2E-004` tests (mock disk depletion)

3. **RecordingPanel.test.tsx Hook errors**
   - **Priority**: P0 (blocks all UI validation)
   - **Probability**: High (100% failure rate for component tests)
   - **Impact**: Critical (cannot verify UI controls work)
   - **Risk Score**: 9 (High × Critical = 9)
   - **Mitigation**: Manual testing only (not acceptable for P1/P0 features)
   - **Remediation**: Fix Hook errors (React version mismatch or improper mocking)

4. **AC#6: Cancel recording untested**
   - **Priority**: P1
   - **Probability**: Medium (partial file not deleted)
   - **Impact**: Medium (disk space wasted, user confusion)
   - **Risk Score**: 4 (Medium × Medium = 4)
   - **Mitigation**: Manual testing only
   - **Remediation**: Add `2.5-UNIT-020` + `2.5-E2E-002` tests

5. **AC#5: Pause/resume MVP placeholders (Finding M1)**
   - **Priority**: P1
   - **Probability**: High (users expect pause to stop recording)
   - **Impact**: Medium (misleading UX, no resource savings)
   - **Risk Score**: 6 (High × Medium = 6)
   - **Mitigation**: Document in README as MVP limitation
   - **Remediation**: Full implementation (ScreenCaptureKit pause + FFmpeg restart) deferred to future epic

**Overall Residual Risk**: **CRITICAL** ❌

**Deployment Status:** **BLOCKED until P0 gaps resolved** ❌
