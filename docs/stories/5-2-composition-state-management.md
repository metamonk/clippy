## Dev Notes

### Architecture Alignment

**Follows ADR-007 (Playback Modes):**
- Composition state is entirely separate from preview state
- `playerStore.mode` determines which state is active
- Single MPV instance coordinates between modes via `playerStore`

**Zustand State Management (ADR-003):**
- Composition state optimized for 60 FPS updates
- Use selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Immutable state updates for React compatibility

**Timeline Data Model (Architecture.md):**
- Queries `timelineStore` for clip/track data
- Maintains own playback cursor (`currentCompositionTime`)
- Does NOT modify timeline state (read-only queries)

### Project Structure Notes

**New Files:**
- `src/stores/compositionStore.ts` - Composition playback state store
- `src/lib/timeline/compositionQueries.ts` - Clip query utilities (optional refactor)

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/components/player/VideoPlayer.tsx` - Add composition mode branch
- `src/stores/playerStore.ts` - May need composition mode coordination

**Testing Files:**
- `src/stores/compositionStore.test.ts` - Unit tests for store actions
- `src/lib/timeline/compositionQueries.test.ts` - Query logic tests (if separated)

### Key Implementation Details

**Clip Boundary Detection Algorithm:**
```typescript
function getNextClipBoundary(currentTime: number, tracks: Track[]): number | null {
  let earliestBoundary: number | null = null;

  for (const track of tracks) {
    for (const clip of track.clips) {
      const clipStart = clip.startTime;
      const clipEnd = clip.startTime + clip.duration;

      // Check start boundary
      if (clipStart > currentTime && (earliestBoundary === null || clipStart < earliestBoundary)) {
        earliestBoundary = clipStart;
      }

      // Check end boundary
      if (clipEnd > currentTime && (earliestBoundary === null || clipEnd < earliestBoundary)) {
        earliestBoundary = clipEnd;
      }
    }
  }

  return earliestBoundary;
}
```

**Active Clip Query Algorithm:**
```typescript
function getActiveClipsAtTime(time: number, tracks: Track[]): ActiveClip[] {
  const activeClips: ActiveClip[] = [];

  for (const track of tracks) {
    for (const clip of track.clips) {
      const clipStart = clip.startTime;
      const clipEnd = clip.startTime + clip.duration;

      // Check if time is within clip bounds
      if (time >= clipStart && time < clipEnd) {
        activeClips.push({
          clip,
          trackId: track.id,
          trackType: track.trackType,
          relativeTime: time - clipStart, // Time offset within clip
        });
      }
    }
  }

  return activeClips;
}
```

**Performance Optimization Strategy:**
- **Boundary Caching:** Only recalculate active clips when crossing a boundary
- **Early Exit:** If `currentTime` unchanged, skip query
- **Indexed Lookup:** Consider track-indexed data structure for large timelines (future optimization)

### Gap Detection Strategy

**Gap Definition:**
- Timeline region where NO clips exist on ANY track
- Not an error - intentional spacing for pacing/transitions

**Gap Handling (Story 5.4):**
- Detect gap: `getActiveClipsAtTime(time).length === 0`
- Render black frames + silence during gaps
- Continue playhead advancement through gaps

### Multi-Track Considerations

**Clip Priority:**
- Multiple clips at same time is EXPECTED (multi-track)
- Track z-index determines rendering order (Story 5.6)
- All clips at time must be returned for compositing

**Audio Mixing:**
- All audio clips at time must be mixed (Story 5.5)
- Composition state provides list of active audio clips
- Audio mixing logic handled by separate service

### State Update Performance

**60 FPS Target:**
- 16.67ms budget per frame
- State update must complete in < 16ms to avoid dropped frames
- Measure via `performance.now()` in development builds

**Optimization Techniques:**
- Memoize clip queries between boundaries
- Use Zustand selectors to minimize re-renders
- Batch state updates when possible

### Edge Cases

1. **Empty Timeline:**
   - `getActiveClipsAtTime()` returns empty array
   - Composition renders black frames (Story 5.4)

2. **Overlapping Clips on Same Track:**
   - Currently allowed by timeline editor (no validation)
   - Query returns ALL overlapping clips
   - Rendering priority TBD (Story 5.6)

3. **Audio-Only Tracks:**
   - Clip has audio but no video
   - Included in `activeClips` array
   - Video rendering skipped, audio mixed (Story 5.5)

4. **Clip at Exact Boundary:**
   - Use inclusive start `>=`, exclusive end `<` for boundary detection
   - Example: clip at 1000ms-2000ms
     - Query at 1000ms: INCLUDES clip
     - Query at 2000ms: EXCLUDES clip (next clip starts here)

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests (Vitest):**
- Test all state actions in isolation
- Mock `timelineStore` data for queries
- Verify state transitions are immutable
- Test performance with large datasets (100+ clips)

**Integration Tests:**
- Test `VideoPlayer` mode switching
- Verify composition state updates during simulated playback
- Test boundary crossing detection

**Performance Tests:**
- Measure state update time with real timeline data
- Test with maximum complexity (10+ tracks, 50+ clips)
- Verify < 16ms update time requirement

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Summary:**

Story 5.2 successfully establishes the foundation for timeline composition playback by implementing a dedicated composition state store that is completely separate from single-clip preview state, in accordance with ADR-007.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1. **Composition Store Created** (AC #1, #2)
   - Implemented `src/stores/compositionStore.ts` with Zustand + devtools middleware
   - Defined TypeScript interfaces: `CompositionState`, `ActiveClip`, `RenderState` enum
   - State tracks: `currentCompositionTime`, `activeClips`, `activeTracks`, `renderState`, `nextBoundaryTime`

2. **Clip Query System** (AC #4, #5, #6)
   - `getActiveClipsAtTime(time)`: Returns all active clips at given time across all tracks (multi-track support)
   - `detectGaps(time)`: Identifies timeline regions without clips
   - `updateActiveClips(time)`: Updates state with active clips and tracks
   - Inclusive start (`>=`), exclusive end (`<`) boundary logic implemented correctly

3. **Clip Boundary Detection** (AC #4)
   - `getNextClipBoundary(currentTime)`: Finds earliest clip start/end boundary after current time
   - `nextBoundaryTime` cached in state for optimization
   - Supports overlapping clips on different tracks

4. **VideoPlayer Integration** (AC #3)
   - VideoPlayer checks `playerStore.mode` to determine active state system
   - When `mode === 'timeline'`, composition state is used via `setCompositionTime()`
   - Gap detection integrated (logs detected gaps for Story 5.4)
   - Preview mode completely unaffected by composition state changes

5. **Performance Optimization** (AC #8)
   - Performance measurement with `performance.now()` in `setCompositionTime()`
   - Warning logged if state update exceeds 16ms (60 FPS target)
   - Boundary caching strategy reduces unnecessary clip queries
   - All tests complete in < 16ms for simple timelines

6. **Comprehensive Testing** (AC #7)
   - 30 unit tests created, all passing
   - Coverage includes:
     - Single/multiple clip queries
     - Gap detection (empty timeline, sparse clips)
     - Clip boundary detection (start/end boundaries)
     - Multi-track scenarios (2-4 tracks, mixed audio/video)
     - Edge cases (overlapping clips, empty timeline, boundary conditions)
     - Performance validation

**Technical Details:**

- **State Separation:** Composition state is entirely independent from `playerStore` preview state, with coordination only through `playerStore.mode` flag
- **Query Strategy:** Direct read from `timelineStore.getState()` for clip/track data - composition store does NOT duplicate timeline data
- **Boundary Logic:** Inclusive start (`time >= clipStart`), exclusive end (`time < clipEnd`) ensures correct clip selection at boundaries
- **Performance:** State updates measured and warned if exceeding 16ms threshold (NFR001 requirement)

**Integration Points:**

- Story 5.3 (Sequential Clip Playback) will use `activeClips` array to drive clip switching
- Story 5.4 (Gap Handling) will use `detectGaps()` to render black frames during gaps
- Story 5.5 (Multi-Track Audio Mixing) will use `activeClips` filtered by `trackType === 'audio'`
- Story 5.6 (Multi-Track Video Compositing) will use `activeClips` with track z-index for rendering order

**Known Limitations:**

- Gap handling currently only logs - black frame rendering deferred to Story 5.4
- Sequential clip switching not yet implemented - deferred to Story 5.3
- Performance testing with very large timelines (100+ clips) not automated (manual testing recommended)

### File List

**New Files:**
- `src/stores/compositionStore.ts` - Composition playback state store with Zustand
- `src/stores/compositionStore.test.ts` - Comprehensive unit tests (30 tests, all passing)

| **ADR-005** | Milliseconds for time | ✅ FULL | All timestamps in milliseconds (`currentCompositionTime`, `relativeTime`, etc.) |

### State Management Patterns

**Correct Implementations:**
- ✅ Immutable updates (no direct state mutation)
- ✅ Devtools middleware with action names
- ✅ Performance measurement integrated
- ✅ Selector-friendly structure (flat state, derived queries)

**Query Strategy:**
- ✅ Direct read from `timelineStore.getState()` - no data duplication
- ✅ Composition store maintains only playback cursor and active clip cache
- ✅ Boundary caching for optimization (`nextBoundaryTime`)

### Integration Points Validated

| Integration | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| `timelineStore` | ✅ | Read-only queries, no timeline state mutation |
| `playerStore` | ✅ | Mode coordination via `playerStore.mode` |
| `VideoPlayer` | ✅ | Composition state used when `mode === 'timeline'` |

## Security Notes

**No Security Concerns Identified** ✅

This story implements state management logic with no external inputs, file I/O, or network operations.

**Input Validation:**
- Time values queried from internal state (no user input)
- Track IDs validated (returns null for invalid IDs)
