## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story implements video file import functionality, establishing the data pipeline from file system → Rust backend → frontend state → UI display.

**Core Pattern: Tauri IPC for File Operations**

This story follows the standard Tauri command pattern for secure file access:
1. Frontend triggers import via drag-drop or button click
2. Frontend calls Tauri command with file paths
3. Rust backend validates, extracts metadata, returns structured data
4. Frontend stores in Zustand state
5. UI reactively displays imported files

**Technology Stack (from architecture.md):**
- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Zustand state management
- **Backend:** Rust with Tauri 2.x commands, serde for serialization
- **File Dialog:** Tauri `dialog` plugin for native macOS file picker
- **Drag & Drop:** Tauri built-in drag-drop events
- **Video Metadata:** FFmpeg via `ffmpeg-sidecar` crate (architecture.md line 98)

**File Format Support:**
- **Phase 1 (This Story):** MP4 and MOV only
- **Validation:** Check file extension, reject unsupported formats
- **Future:** WebM support can be added in later stories

**Data Flow:**

```
User Action (Drag or Click)
  ↓
Frontend: Trigger import
  ↓
Tauri Command: cmd_import_media (Rust)
  ├─ Validate file format
  ├─ Extract metadata with FFmpeg (duration, resolution, codec)
  ├─ Generate thumbnail (optional for this story)
  └─ Return MediaFile struct
  ↓
Frontend: Add to mediaLibraryStore (Zustand)
  ↓
UI: MediaLibraryPanel displays new item
```

**MediaFile Data Model (from architecture.md lines 1378-1391):**

```typescript
interface MediaFile {
  id: string;              // UUID
  filePath: string;        // Absolute path
  filename: string;        // Display name
  duration: number;        // Milliseconds
  resolution: { width: number; height: number };
  fileSize: number;        // Bytes
  codec: string;           // e.g., "h264", "hevc"
  thumbnail?: string;      // Base64 or file path (optional for this story)
  importedAt: string;      // ISO 8601 timestamp
}
```

```

**Lessons from Story 1.2:**
- Use lucide-react icons (Upload icon for import button)
- Implement keyboard accessibility (Enter key on drop zone)
- Write comprehensive Vitest tests
- Use @/ path alias for imports
- Apply Tailwind CSS exclusively
- Add focus indicators for keyboard navigation

**Error Handling Strategy:**

Frontend (toast notifications):
- "Unsupported file format. Please import MP4 or MOV files."
- "Failed to import file: [filename]. Please check the file is not corrupted."

Backend (Rust → String errors):
- Validate file extension before processing
- Catch FFmpeg metadata extraction failures
- Return user-friendly error messages (not stack traces)

**Testing Strategy (from architecture.md lines 1129-1211):**

Frontend (Vitest + React Testing Library):
- MediaImport renders drop zone and button
- Drag-drop triggers Tauri command
- Button click opens file picker
- Error toast displays on unsupported format
- Imported files appear in UI

Backend (cargo test):
- MediaFile struct serialization
- File path validation
- Metadata extraction (mocked FFmpeg for unit tests)

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Architecture:**

This story strictly follows the architecture defined in architecture.md:
- Component location: `src/components/media-library/` ✓ (architecture.md line 128)
- Tauri command: `src-tauri/src/commands/media.rs` ✓ (architecture.md line 188)
- Zustand store: `src/stores/mediaLibraryStore.ts` ✓ (architecture.md line 154)
- Data model: Matches MediaFile interface ✓ (architecture.md lines 1378-1391)

**Naming Conventions (from architecture.md lines 561-585):**

Rust:
- File: `media.rs` (snake_case)
- Struct: `MediaFile` (PascalCase)
- Command: `cmd_import_media` (snake_case with cmd_ prefix)

TypeScript:
- Components: `MediaImport.tsx` (PascalCase)
- Utilities: `media.ts` (camelCase)
- Functions: `importMedia`, `addMediaFile` (camelCase)

**No Conflicts Detected**

The architecture provides clear guidance for this story. The only decision point is whether to implement thumbnail generation in this story or defer to Story 1.5. Recommendation: **Defer thumbnails to Story 1.5** (Media Library Panel with Thumbnails) to keep this story focused on import mechanics.

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** zeno
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Outcome:** Changes Requested

### Summary

Story 1.3 implements comprehensive video file import functionality with drag-and-drop, file picker, and FFmpeg metadata extraction. The implementation demonstrates strong architectural alignment and good test coverage (12 Rust tests passing, 27 frontend tests). However, critical React lifecycle issues, a build-blocking TypeScript error, and one failing test must be addressed before merging.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Excellent Rust backend implementation with proper error handling and structured logging
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage across both frontend and backend
- ✅ Strong adherence to architecture (Tauri command patterns, data models, naming conventions)
- ✅ User-friendly error messages and toast notifications
- ✅ Good separation of concerns (models, commands, utilities)

**Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Fix:**
- 🔴 React lifecycle bug: `useState` misused for side effects (event listener setup)
- 🔴 Build failure: TypeScript compilation error (unused variable in test)
- 🔴 Test failure: Legacy test expects old empty state text

### Key Findings

#### High Severity

1. **React Lifecycle Violation - Event Listener Setup**
   - **Location:** src/components/media-library/MediaImport.tsx:117-132
   - **Issue:** Using `useState(() => {...})` instead of `useEffect(() => {...}, [])` for setting up event listeners
   - **Impact:** Event listener is set up during render phase, not after mount. This violates React's rules and can cause:
     - Multiple listeners registered on re-renders
     - Memory leaks (cleanup function may not run correctly)
     - Unpredictable behavior during concurrent rendering
   - **Fix:** Replace `useState(() => {...})` with `useEffect(() => {...}, [])`
   ```typescript
   // INCORRECT (current):
   useState(() => {
     let unlisten: (() => void) | undefined;
     listen<string[]>("tauri://drag-drop", ...).then(...);
     return () => { if (unlisten) unlisten(); };
   });

   // CORRECT:
   useEffect(() => {
     let unlisten: (() => void) | undefined;
     listen<string[]>("tauri://drag-drop", ...).then(...);
     return () => { if (unlisten) unlisten(); };
   }, []);
   ```

2. **Build Failure - TypeScript Compilation Error**
   - **Location:** src/stores/mediaLibraryStore.test.ts:39
   - **Issue:** Unused variable `mediaFiles` declared but never read
   - **Impact:** Blocks production builds with `npm run build`
   - **Fix:** Remove unused destructured variable or use underscore prefix `_mediaFiles`

3. **Failing Test - Outdated Expectations**
   - **Location:** src/components/layout/MediaLibraryPanel.test.tsx:10
   - **Issue:** Test expects old empty state text pattern `/no media imported.*use file.*import/i`, but component now shows "No media imported yet. Drag files above or click Import Video."
   - **Impact:** CI/CD pipeline failures
   - **Fix:** Update test expectation to match actual component text or use more flexible matcher

#### Medium Severity

4. **Potential Race Condition in Sequential Imports**
   - **Location:** src/components/media-library/MediaImport.tsx:78-80
   - **Issue:** File picker loops with `await` but `isImporting` state resets per file, not per batch
   - **Impact:**
     - User can trigger another file picker while batch is processing
     - Loading state doesn't accurately reflect batch progress
   - **Recommendation:** Track batch import state separately or disable interactions during entire batch

5. **Error Handling Doesn't Halt Batch on Failure**
   - **Location:** src/components/media-library/MediaImport.tsx:78-80
   - **Issue:** If one file fails in a batch, the loop continues importing remaining files
   - **Impact:** User may miss errors in large batches (only last toast visible)
   - **Recommendation:** Consider user preference: fail-fast vs. continue-on-error

6. **FFmpeg Auto-Download on Every Import**
   - **Location:** src-tauri/src/utils/ffmpeg.rs:38
   - **Issue:** `ffmpeg_sidecar::download::auto_download()` called on every metadata extraction
   - **Impact:** Unnecessary I/O checks on every import (though auto_download is idempotent)
   - **Recommendation:** Move to one-time initialization in app startup (src-tauri/src/lib.rs)

#### Low Severity

7. **Missing Path Traversal Validation**
   - **Location:** src-tauri/src/commands/media.rs:16
   - **Issue:** File paths not explicitly sanitized for path traversal attempts (e.g., `../../sensitive`)
   - **Impact:** Low risk - Tauri's allowlist and macOS sandbox provide protection, but explicit validation is best practice
   - **Recommendation:** Add path canonicalization and validate file is within allowed directories

8. **No Duplicate File Detection**
   - **Location:** src/stores/mediaLibraryStore.ts:35-42
   - **Issue:** Same file can be imported multiple times (no filePath deduplication)
   - **Impact:** User experience issue - confusing to see duplicate entries
   - **Recommendation:** Check for existing filePath before adding, or show "already imported" message

9. **Test Uses Deprecated Pattern**
   - **Location:** Multiple test files use `import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest"`
   - **Issue:** Vitest globals are enabled in config, but tests still import explicitly
   - **Impact:** Inconsistent patterns, minor code bloat
   - **Recommendation:** Remove explicit imports and rely on globals (or disable globals and keep imports)

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC | Description | Status | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|-------|
| AC1 | Drag & drop zone accepts MP4/MOV | ✅ Passed | Well-implemented with visual feedback |
| AC2 | File picker dialog (native macOS) | ✅ Passed | Tauri dialog plugin correctly integrated |
| AC3 | Imported files stored in state | ✅ Passed | Zustand store properly implemented |
| AC4 | File validation with clear errors | ✅ Passed | Frontend + backend validation, user-friendly messages |
| AC5 | Rust backend handles metadata | ✅ Passed | FFmpeg integration works correctly |

**Overall AC Coverage:** 5/5 (100%) - All acceptance criteria functionally met, pending bug fixes.

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Frontend Tests:** 27 tests across 4 test suites
- ✅ mediaLibraryStore.test.ts: 8/8 passing
- ✅ MediaItem.test.tsx: 10/10 passing
- ⚠️ MediaLibraryPanel.test.tsx: 8/9 passing (1 failing - outdated expectation)
- ✅ MediaImport.test.tsx: Tests passing but component has React lifecycle bug

**Backend Tests:** 12 tests passing
- ✅ All Rust unit tests passing (models, commands, utils)
- ✅ Error handling paths well-covered
- ✅ Format validation tested

**Gaps:**
1. ❌ No integration test with real video file (only dummy files)
2. ❌ No test for drag-drop event listener cleanup (would catch the useState bug)
3. ❌ No test for batch import behavior (multiple files at once)
4. ⚠️ FFmpeg metadata extraction only tests error paths (mock FFmpeg output not tested)

### Architectural Alignment

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Perfect adherence to Tauri command patterns (Result<T, String>, structured logging)
- ✅ Data models match architecture spec exactly (MediaFile, Resolution with camelCase serialization)
- ✅ File structure follows architecture.md (components/media-library/, stores/, lib/tauri/, models/, commands/)
- ✅ Naming conventions correct (snake_case Rust, camelCase TypeScript, PascalCase components)
- ✅ Error handling follows patterns (anyhow for Rust, user-friendly strings for frontend)

**Deviations:**
- ⚠️ FFmpeg initialization pattern not optimal (should be one-time startup, currently per-import)
- ⚠️ No explicit path validation (architecture emphasizes security best practices)

### Security Notes

**Positive Security Practices:**
- ✅ File format validation before processing (defense in depth)
- ✅ Error messages don't leak system paths or stack traces
- ✅ Structured logging for audit trail (tracing with structured fields)
- ✅ Tauri's sandboxing provides baseline protection

**Security Recommendations:**
1. **Path Traversal:** Add explicit path canonicalization and allowlist validation
   ```rust
   let canonical_path = std::fs::canonicalize(&file_path)?;
   // Validate canonical_path is within allowed directories
   ```

2. **Command Injection:** FFmpeg command uses array args (not shell string), ✅ safe from injection

3. **Resource Exhaustion:** No limits on concurrent imports or file sizes
   - Recommendation: Add file size limit (e.g., 5GB) and concurrent import limit (e.g., 3)

4. **Tauri Allowlist:** Verify tauri.conf.json has appropriate fs/dialog/shell allowlists configured

**FFmpeg Best Practices:**
- ✅ Uses ffprobe JSON output (parseable, reliable)
- ⚠️ Consider caching metadata to avoid re-extraction on app restart

### Action Items

#### Must Fix (Blocking)

1. **[HIGH] Fix React lifecycle bug in MediaImport.tsx**
   - Replace `useState` with `useEffect` for event listener setup (lines 117-132)
   - Related AC: AC1, AC2
   - File: src/components/media-library/MediaImport.tsx:117-132

2. **[HIGH] Fix TypeScript compilation error**
   - Remove or rename unused `mediaFiles` variable in test
   - Related file: src/stores/mediaLibraryStore.test.ts:39

3. **[HIGH] Fix failing MediaLibraryPanel test**
   - Update test expectation to match actual empty state text
   - File: src/components/layout/MediaLibraryPanel.test.tsx:10

#### Should Fix (Important)

4. **[MED] Improve batch import UX**
   - Add batch-level loading state and error aggregation
   - Consider showing import progress (e.g., "Importing 3 of 5 files...")
   - File: src/components/media-library/MediaImport.tsx:62-84

5. **[MED] Move FFmpeg initialization to startup**
   - Call `ffmpeg_sidecar::download::auto_download()` in app startup
   - Remove from per-import path
   - Files: src-tauri/src/lib.rs, src-tauri/src/utils/ffmpeg.rs:38

6. **[MED] Add duplicate file detection**
   - Check if filePath already exists before adding to store
   - Show user-friendly message: "File already imported"
   - File: src/stores/mediaLibraryStore.ts:35-42

#### Nice to Have (Enhancements)

7. **[LOW] Add path traversal validation**
   - Canonicalize paths and validate against allowlist
   - File: src-tauri/src/commands/media.rs:16

8. **[LOW] Add resource limits**
   - Max file size (5GB) and concurrent import limit (3)
   - File: src-tauri/src/commands/media.rs

9. **[LOW] Add integration test with real video**
   - Create minimal valid MP4 for end-to-end test
   - Test actual FFmpeg metadata extraction

10. **[LOW] Improve test consistency**
    - Either use Vitest globals everywhere or import everywhere
    - Currently mixing both patterns

## Senior Developer Review #2 (AI)

**Reviewer:** zeno
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Outcome:** Changes Requested

### Summary

Second review of Story 1.3 after implementing all 6 action items from the first review. Excellent progress made - all critical bugs fixed, React lifecycle issues resolved, FFmpeg initialization optimized, and comprehensive batch import UX implemented. However, one blocking issue remains: unused `handleImport` function causing TypeScript compilation failure.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ All 6 previous action items successfully implemented and tested
- ✅ React lifecycle bug completely resolved (useEffect properly implemented)
- ✅ Batch import UX significantly improved with progress tracking and error aggregation
- ✅ FFmpeg initialization moved to app startup for better performance
- ✅ Duplicate file detection working correctly
- ✅ All tests passing (12 Rust tests, 113 frontend tests)
- ✅ TypeScript types properly defined, no compilation errors in test files

**Critical Issue:**
- 🔴 Unused `handleImport` function (line 39) blocking production builds

### Key Findings

#### High Severity

1. **TypeScript Compilation Error - Unused Function**
   - **Location:** src/components/media-library/MediaImport.tsx:39
   - **Issue:** `handleImport` function declared but never used (refactoring to `handleBatchImport` left unused code)
   - **Impact:** `npm run build` fails with error TS6133, blocking production deployment
   - **Fix:** Remove the unused `handleImport` function entirely, as all import operations now go through `handleBatchImport`

#### Medium Severity

2. **ESLint Configuration Issue - React Import**
   - **Location:** src/components/media-library/MediaImport.tsx:158, 167, 177, 204
   - **Issue:** ESLint reports 'React' is not defined in type annotations (e.g., `React.DragEvent`, `React.KeyboardEvent`)
   - **Impact:** ESLint failures, inconsistent code quality checks
   - **Context:** React 19 doesn't require explicit import for JSX, but TypeScript still needs `React` namespace for type annotations
   - **Fix:** Either add `import React from 'react'` or update ESLint config to recognize React 19 patterns

3. **Test Infrastructure - Tauri Mock Issues**
   - **Location:** Test suite (all MediaImport-related tests)
   - **Issue:** Unhandled promise rejections from Tauri `listen` API in test environment (18 unhandled errors)
   - **Impact:** Test output cluttered with warnings, potential for false positives
   - **Context:** Tests pass but generate warnings: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'transformCallback')"
   - **Recommendation:** Mock `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__` in test setup or mock the `listen` API properly

#### Low Severity

4. **ESLint Configuration - Dist Folder**
   - **Location:** .eslintignore or eslint.config.js
   - **Issue:** ESLint runs on `dist/` folder (build output), generating false positives
   - **Recommendation:** Add `dist/` to `.eslintignore` or update eslint.config.js to exclude build artifacts

## Senior Developer Review #3 (AI)

**Reviewer:** zeno
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Outcome:** Changes Requested

### Summary

Third review of Story 1.3 confirms excellent progress since review #2. This story implements comprehensive video file import functionality with exceptional architectural alignment, robust error handling, and strong test coverage (12 Rust tests, 113 frontend tests - all passing). However, one trivial cleanup issue remains from refactoring work: an unused function causing TypeScript compilation failure that blocks production builds.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ All 6 action items from first review successfully implemented
- ✅ Excellent React patterns: proper useEffect lifecycle management, batch state handling
- ✅ Robust Rust backend: proper error handling, structured logging, FFmpeg integration
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage with 100% passing tests
- ✅ Strong architectural adherence: Tauri patterns, data models, naming conventions
- ✅ Outstanding UX improvements: batch import with progress tracking, duplicate detection, aggregated error reporting
- ✅ FFmpeg initialization optimized at app startup (performance improvement)

**Critical Issue:**
- 🔴 One unused function from refactoring (lines 39-62) blocking production builds - trivial 30-second fix

### Key Findings

#### High Severity

1. **TypeScript Compilation Error - Unused Function**
   - **Location:** src/components/media-library/MediaImport.tsx:39-62
   - **Issue:** `handleImport` function declared but never used (replaced by `handleBatchImport` during refactoring)
   - **Impact:** `npm run build` fails with TypeScript error TS6133, blocking production deployment
   - **Build Output:**
     ```
     src/components/media-library/MediaImport.tsx(39,9): error TS6133: 'handleImport' is declared but its value is never read.
     ```
   - **Fix:** Delete lines 39-62 (the entire `handleImport` function)
   - **Rationale:** This function was superseded by `handleBatchImport` which handles both single and batch imports with better UX (progress tracking, error aggregation, duplicate detection)

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC | Description | Status | Implementation Quality |
|----|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| AC1 | Drag & drop zone accepts MP4/MOV | ✅ Passed | Excellent - Tauri event listeners, visual feedback, batch support |
| AC2 | File picker dialog (native macOS) | ✅ Passed | Excellent - Native dialog with format filters, batch selection |
| AC3 | Imported files stored in state | ✅ Passed | Excellent - Zustand store with duplicate detection, devtools |
| AC4 | File validation with clear errors | ✅ Passed | Excellent - Frontend + backend validation, aggregated error messages |
| AC5 | Rust backend handles metadata | ✅ Passed | Excellent - FFmpeg integration with structured logging, startup optimization |

**Overall AC Coverage:** 5/5 (100%) - All acceptance criteria met with high-quality implementations.

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Frontend Tests:** 113 tests passing (100%)
- ✅ Media library store: 8/8 tests passing
- ✅ MediaItem component: 10/10 tests passing
- ✅ MediaImport component: comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ MediaLibraryPanel: all tests updated and passing
- ✅ Batch import behavior well-tested
- ✅ Duplicate detection tested
- ⚠️ 18 unhandled promise rejections from Tauri mock (tests pass, warnings only - not blocking)

**Backend Tests:** 12 tests passing (100%)
- ✅ MediaFile struct serialization/deserialization
- ✅ File format validation (MP4, MOV accepted; others rejected)
- ✅ Missing file error handling
- ✅ FFmpeg metadata extraction error paths
- ✅ Resolution struct serialization

**Build Status:**
- ❌ `npm run build` - FAILS due to unused function (blocking)
- ✅ `npm run test` - PASSES (113/113 tests)
- ✅ `cargo test` - PASSES (12/12 tests)
- ✅ `cargo build` - PASSES

**Test Quality Assessment:**
This story has exceptionally strong test coverage across both frontend and backend. All critical paths are tested, including error scenarios, edge cases, and user interactions. The only gap is the Tauri mock setup issue causing warnings (non-blocking, addressed in action items as "Nice to Have").

### Architectural Alignment

**Exceptional Adherence:**
- ✅ Perfect Tauri command patterns (Result<T, String>, structured logging, async/await)
- ✅ Data models match architecture spec exactly (MediaFile with camelCase serialization)
- ✅ File structure follows architecture.md precisely
- ✅ Naming conventions 100% correct (snake_case Rust, camelCase TypeScript, PascalCase components)
- ✅ Error handling patterns consistent with architecture (anyhow for Rust, user-friendly strings for frontend)
- ✅ React lifecycle patterns now correct after review #1 fixes
- ✅ FFmpeg initialization pattern optimal after review #2 fixes

**Notable Improvements Since Previous Reviews:**
1. React lifecycle: Migrated from incorrect useState to proper useEffect for event listeners
2. FFmpeg startup: Moved from per-import to app startup initialization (performance boost)
3. Batch UX: Added progress tracking and error aggregation for professional user experience
4. Duplicate detection: Prevents re-importing same files (UX + state cleanliness)

### Security Notes

**Strong Security Posture:**
- ✅ File format validation before processing (defense in depth)
- ✅ Error messages don't leak system paths or stack traces
- ✅ Structured logging for audit trail (tracing with structured fields)
- ✅ Tauri's sandboxing provides baseline protection
- ✅ FFmpeg command uses array args (safe from command injection)

**No New Security Issues Identified**

All security recommendations from previous reviews remain valid but are non-blocking:
- Path traversal validation (low priority - Tauri sandbox provides protection)
- Resource limits (file size, concurrent imports) - enhancement for future stories

- **Outcome:** Changes Requested

**Review #2:**
- 1 High priority issue (unused function from refactoring)
- 2 Medium priority issues (ESLint config, test infrastructure)
- **Outcome:** Changes Requested
- **Note:** All 6 action items from Review #1 successfully implemented

**Review #3 (Current):**
- 1 High priority issue (same unused function - still not removed)
- 2 Low priority enhancements (test mocks, ESLint config)
- **Outcome:** Changes Requested
- **Note:** No new functional issues; only cleanup remaining

**Overall Progress:**
From critical React bugs and architectural issues → One trivial cleanup issue. Story is **95% complete** with excellent implementation quality.

### Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Remove the unused `handleImport` function (30-second fix)
2. **Re-test:** Run `npm run build` to verify TypeScript compilation succeeds
3. **Merge:** Once build passes, this story is ready for Done status
4. **Future:** Consider addressing the test mock warnings in a separate tech debt story (non-blocking)

### Conclusion

Story 1.3 represents **exceptional engineering work** with strong architectural alignment, comprehensive testing, and thoughtful UX design. The implementation successfully addresses all acceptance criteria and includes significant quality improvements from two rounds of code review feedback.

The single remaining issue is a trivial cleanup task (removing 24 lines of unused code) that takes 30 seconds to fix but blocks production builds. Once resolved, this story demonstrates production-ready quality and sets a strong standard for subsequent stories in Epic 1.
