## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story implements the foundational architecture decisions from [architecture.md](../architecture.md):

**Technology Stack:**
- Tauri 2.x framework (latest 2025 version)
- React 18 with TypeScript 5.x
- Vite build tool for fast HMR
- Tailwind CSS 3.x for styling
- shadcn/ui component library (Radix UI + Tailwind)
- Zustand for state management (will be used in later stories)

**Key Dependencies (from architecture.md):**

Frontend:
```bash
npm install zustand konva react-konva video.js @videojs/themes
npm install @tauri-apps/api @tauri-apps/plugin-fs @tauri-apps/plugin-dialog
npm install @tauri-apps/plugin-notification @tauri-apps/plugin-shell @tauri-apps/plugin-os
```

Rust (Cargo.toml):
```toml
[dependencies]
tauri = { version = "2", features = ["..." ] }
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
anyhow = "1"
thiserror = "1"
tracing = "0.1"
tracing-subscriber = "0.3"
chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }
uuid = { version = "1", features = ["v4", "serde"] }
async-openai = "0.28"
ffmpeg-sidecar = "2.1"
screencapturekit = "0.3"
nokhwa = { version = "0.10", features = ["input-avfoundation"] }
```

**Logging Strategy:**
- File: ~/Library/Logs/clippy/app.log (macOS standard location)
- Use tracing crate with structured fields
- Levels: error!, warn!, info!, debug!, trace!
- Example: `tracing::info!(event = "app_startup", version = env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"))`

**Testing Requirements:**
- Frontend: Vitest + React Testing Library
- Backend: cargo test with standard Rust testing
- Sample tests must pass to satisfy AC #7 and #8

**macOS Conventions:**
- Native window chrome (system titlebar, traffic lights)
- Native menu bar with app name
- Respects system light/dark mode
- Minimum window size enforced (1280x720) - to be implemented in Story 1.2

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** zeno
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Outcome:** Changes Requested

### Summary

Story 1.1 establishes a solid Tauri + React foundation with most acceptance criteria met. The implementation successfully initializes the project structure, configures testing infrastructure, sets up logging, and installs all required dependencies. However, critical configuration files for ESLint and Prettier (AC #9) are missing, and there are ESLint errors present in the codebase that need resolution before this story can be marked complete.

### Key Findings

**High Severity:**

1. **Missing ESLint and Prettier Configuration Files** (AC #9)
   - **Finding:** eslint.config.js and .prettierrc files do not exist in the project root
   - **Evidence:** `ls` command confirms files are missing; `npm run lint` and `npm run format` scripts exist in package.json but reference non-existent configurations
   - **Impact:** AC #9 "ESLint and Prettier configured with project standards" is not met
   - **Required Action:** Create eslint.config.js with proper TypeScript support and environment globals (document, window, process, __dirname). Create .prettierrc with project formatting standards
   - **Related Files:** package.json:12-13 (scripts defined but config missing)

**Medium Severity:**

2. **ESLint Errors Present in Codebase**
   - **Finding:** 5 ESLint errors related to undefined globals (document, HTMLElement, process, __dirname)
   - **Evidence:** `npm run lint` output shows errors in src/App.test.tsx:8, src/main.tsx:6, vite.config.ts:5, vitest.config.ts:14
   - **Impact:** Code quality standards not enforced; linting workflow broken
   - **Required Action:** Add proper environment configuration to ESLint (browser, node globals) and fix or suppress legitimate violations
   - **Related Files:** src/App.test.tsx:8, src/main.tsx:6, vite.config.ts:5, vitest.config.ts:14

**Low Severity:**

3. **Manual Verification Tasks Not Documented**
   - **Finding:** Story completion notes claim native macOS integration and hot reload work, but no evidence of manual testing or verification
   - **Impact:** Minor - likely works as claimed given proper configuration in tauri.conf.json, but best practice is to document verification steps
   - **Recommendation:** Add brief manual verification notes to Dev Agent Record confirming: (1) app launches via `npm run tauri dev`, (2) native macOS window chrome appears, (3) hot reload works after code change, (4) menu bar displays "clippy"
   - **Related ACs:** AC #2, AC #3, AC #5, AC #6

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC # | Criterion | Status | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Tauri 2.x project initialized with React 18+ frontend | ✅ PASS | Tauri 2.x with React 19 confirmed in package.json and Cargo.toml |
| 2 | Application launches as native macOS window with menu bar | ⚠️ ASSUMED | tauri.conf.json configured correctly but manual verification not documented |
| 3 | Basic window chrome follows macOS conventions | ⚠️ ASSUMED | titleBarStyle: "Visible", decorations: true set in tauri.conf.json |
| 4 | Project structure organized (src-tauri for Rust backend, src for React frontend) | ✅ PASS | Directory structure matches architecture.md specifications |
| 5 | Development environment configured (hot reload works) | ⚠️ ASSUMED | Vite configured properly but hot reload not verified manually |
| 6 | Can run `cargo tauri dev` and app launches successfully | ⚠️ ASSUMED | Build succeeds but launch not verified in review |
| 7 | Vitest configured for frontend unit tests with sample test passing | ✅ PASS | 2/2 tests passing in src/App.test.tsx |
| 8 | cargo test working for Rust backend with sample test passing | ✅ PASS | 4/4 tests passing in src-tauri/src/utils/mod.rs |
| 9 | ESLint and Prettier configured with project standards | ❌ FAIL | Configuration files missing; ESLint errors present |
| 10 | Logging configured with tracing crate, outputs to ~/Library/Logs/clippy/app.log | ✅ PASS | Log file exists at correct path with structured logging implementation |
| 11 | Git repository initialized with initial commit | ✅ PASS | .gitignore properly configured with node_modules/, target/, dist/ excluded |

**Summary:** 6/11 PASS, 4/11 ASSUMED (likely pass with manual verification), 1/11 FAIL

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Frontend Testing:**
- ✅ Vitest configured with jsdom environment (vitest.config.ts)
- ✅ React Testing Library installed and configured (src/test/setup.ts)
- ✅ Sample tests passing (2/2 in App.test.tsx)
- ✅ Test script working (`npm run test`)

**Backend Testing:**
- ✅ Rust unit tests configured with #[cfg(test)] modules
- ✅ Sample utility tests passing (4/4 in utils/mod.rs)
- ✅ Test command working (`cargo test`)

**Gaps:**
- No integration tests for Tauri commands (acceptable for foundation story)
- No E2E tests (not required for AC, planned for future stories)

### Architectural Alignment

**Adherence to architecture.md:**
- ✅ Technology stack matches: Tauri 2.x, React 19 (spec called for 18+), TypeScript 5.8, Vite 7
- ✅ All specified dependencies installed (npm and Cargo.toml align with architecture.md sections)
- ✅ Project structure follows Complete Project Structure diagram (src/, src-tauri/, docs/ layout correct)
- ✅ Logging strategy implemented per Consistency Rules: tracing crate with file output to ~/Library/Logs/clippy/app.log
- ✅ Error handling pattern established: anyhow for internal Rust functions
- ⚠️ Naming conventions: Rust follows snake_case (good), but ESLint not enforcing TypeScript conventions due to missing config

**Deviations:**
- React 19 used instead of React 18 (acceptable - newer stable version, backward compatible)
- ESLint and Prettier configuration missing (architecture.md:78 specifies these should be configured)

### Security Notes

- ✅ No security concerns for this foundation story
- ✅ .gitignore properly excludes sensitive directories (node_modules/, target/)
- ✅ Logging configuration does not log sensitive data
- ✅ Dependencies are from trusted sources (official Tauri, React, Rust crates)
- ℹ️ Note: macOS permission handling (screen recording, camera, microphone) deferred to Epic 2 stories as intended

### Best-Practices and References

**Tech Stack Context:**
- **Tauri 2.x:** Latest stable release (2025), provides native macOS integration via WebView
- **React 19:** Latest stable (released 2024), includes automatic batching and concurrent features
- **Vite 7:** Latest major version (2025), optimized for fast HMR and modern ES modules
- **TypeScript 5.8:** Latest stable with improved type inference

**Code Quality Tools:**
- **ESLint 9:** Flat config format (eslint.config.js) required for v9
- **Prettier 3:** Latest stable, requires .prettierrc or prettier.config.js
- **Reference:** https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/ (flat config migration guide)
- **Reference:** https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html

**Rust Best Practices Followed:**
- ✅ Use of tracing over println! for logging
- ✅ Proper error handling with anyhow::Result
- ✅ Structured logging with event fields
- ✅ Directory creation with fs::create_dir_all for robustness

**React Best Practices:**
- ✅ Vitest + React Testing Library (current standard over Jest)
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ⚠️ ESLint rules not enforced (pending config file creation)

### Action Items

1. **[High][TechDebt] Create ESLint configuration file**
   - **Description:** Create eslint.config.js with TypeScript parser, React plugin, and proper environment globals
   - **Suggested Owner:** Dev Agent
   - **Related AC:** #9
   - **Files:** Create eslint.config.js at project root
   - **Example Config:**
     ```js
     import tseslint from '@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin';

     export default [
       {
         files: ['**/*.ts', '**/*.tsx'],
         languageOptions: {
           parser: tsparser,
           globals: {
             document: 'readonly',
             window: 'readonly',
             process: 'readonly',
             __dirname: 'readonly',
             HTMLElement: 'readonly'
           }
         },
         plugins: { '@typescript-eslint': tseslint },
         rules: {
           '@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars': 'warn',
           '@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any': 'warn'
         }
       }
     ];
     ```

2. **[High][TechDebt] Create Prettier configuration file**
   - **Description:** Create .prettierrc with project formatting standards (semi-colons, single quotes, 2-space indent)
   - **Suggested Owner:** Dev Agent
   - **Related AC:** #9
   - **Files:** Create .prettierrc at project root
   - **Example Config:**
     ```json
     {
       "semi": true,
       "singleQuote": true,
       "tabWidth": 2,
       "trailingComma": "es5",
       "printWidth": 100
     }
     ```

3. **[Med][Bug] Fix ESLint errors after configuration**
   - **Description:** Run `npm run lint` after creating config and resolve any remaining legitimate violations
   - **Suggested Owner:** Dev Agent
   - **Related AC:** #9
   - **Files:** src/App.test.tsx:8, src/main.tsx:6, vite.config.ts:5, vitest.config.ts:14

4. **[Low][Enhancement] Document manual verification steps**
   - **Description:** Add brief manual verification notes to story confirming native macOS integration and hot reload work
   - **Suggested Owner:** Dev Agent
   - **Related AC:** #2, #3, #5, #6
   - **Verification Steps:**
     - Run `npm run tauri dev` and confirm app launches without errors
     - Verify native macOS window with system traffic lights (red/yellow/green buttons)
     - Verify menu bar shows "clippy" application name
     - Make a code change to src/App.tsx and confirm hot reload updates UI
     - Verify window minimum size enforced (1280x720 from tauri.conf.json)

5. **[Low][Enhancement] Add format check to CI/CD preparation**
   - **Description:** Consider adding `npm run format:check` script to validate code formatting in future CI pipeline
   - **Suggested Owner:** Dev Agent
   - **Related AC:** #9
   - **Files:** package.json (add script: `"format:check": "prettier --check \"src/**/*.{ts,tsx,css}\""`)

---

**Story Status:** This story is functionally solid but fails AC #9 due to missing ESLint and Prettier configuration files. After addressing the 3 High/Med action items above, this story will be ready for approval.
