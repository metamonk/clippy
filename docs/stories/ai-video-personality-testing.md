# AI Video Personality - Testing Guide

## Implementation Summary

A fun AI-powered feature that analyzes recorded videos and generates:
- **Personality Analysis**: Presenting style, energy description, fun stats, and motivational feedback
- **Alternative Narrations**: Rewrites the content in 4 hilarious styles (Movie Trailer, Pirate, Shakespeare, Robot)
- **Full Transcript**: Complete text transcription of the audio

## Prerequisites

1. **OpenAI API Key**: Already embedded in the build for demo purposes
   - ⚠️ See `AI-DEMO-WARNING.md` for security considerations
   - Set usage limits at https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits

2. **FFmpeg**: Already included with the project via ffmpeg-sidecar

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

### 2. Record a Video with Audio
- Click the "Record" button in the app
- Select any recording mode (Screen, Webcam, or PiP)
- **Important**: Make sure to enable microphone audio
- Record at least 30 seconds of speech (narrate what you're doing)
- Click "Stop Recording"

### 3. Trigger AI Analysis
- After stopping, you'll see a "Recording Complete!" screen
- Click the big **"Analyze with AI"** button (purple/blue gradient)
- Wait 15-30 seconds while AI processes your recording

### 4. View Results
The AI Insights panel will show:
- Your presenter style (e.g., "Caffeinated Professor")
- Energy description
- Fun stats about your presentation
- Motivational feedback from an AI coach
- 4 alternative narration versions of your content
- Full transcript (expandable)

## Expected Behavior

### Success Indicators
- ✅ "Recording Complete!" screen appears after stopping
- ✅ "Analyze with AI" button is visible and clickable
- ✅ Loading spinner shows "AI is analyzing your video..."
- ✅ Results display with personality, alternative narrations, and transcript
- ✅ All text is readable and properly formatted

### Known Limitations
- Requires audio in the recording (won't work with silent videos)
- Takes 15-30 seconds to process (Whisper + GPT-4 calls)
- Costs ~$0.02-0.05 per analysis (OpenAI API costs)
- FFmpeg must be installed (auto-downloaded by ffmpeg-sidecar)

## Files Modified/Created

### Backend (Rust)
- `src-tauri/src/commands/ai_analysis.rs` - New AI analysis command
- `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs` - Export AI command
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Register command
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Added `bytes` dependency

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)
- `src/types/ai.ts` - TypeScript types for AI results
- `src/components/recording/AiInsightsPanel.tsx` - AI insights UI component
- `src/components/recording/RecordingPanel.tsx` - Added "Recording Complete" state and trigger button

### Documentation
- `docs/stories/ai-video-personality-quick.md` - Story document
- `docs/stories/ai-video-personality-testing.md` - This testing guide

## Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key not configured"
- This means the `.env` file is missing or invalid
- Contact the developer to get a properly configured build

### "Failed to extract audio"
- Ensure FFmpeg is installed and accessible
- Check that the recording actually has audio

### "Transcription failed" or API errors
- Verify your OpenAI API key is valid
- Check you have credits in your OpenAI account
- Ensure you have access to Whisper and GPT-4 models

### No audio in recording
- Make sure you enabled microphone in the recording settings
- Test your microphone before recording
- Speak clearly during the recording

## Demo Tips for Instructors

1. **Keep it short**: 30-60 second recordings work best for demos
2. **Be expressive**: The AI picks up on energy and style
3. **Speak clearly**: Better transcription = funnier results
4. **Show the variety**: The alternative narrations are the most entertaining part
5. **Re-analyze**: You can click "Re-analyze" to see different variations

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- Auto-generate video thumbnails
- Scene detection and chapter markers
- Export AI insights as PDF/JSON
- Batch analysis of multiple recordings
- Fine-tune personalities with custom prompts
- Add more narration styles
