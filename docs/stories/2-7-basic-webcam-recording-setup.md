## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Camera Capture Architecture (from architecture.md):**
- nokhwa crate v0.10.9 with `input-avfoundation` feature for macOS camera access [Source: docs/architecture.md#Technology Stack, line 100]
- Camera wrapper service in `src-tauri/src/services/camera/nokhwa_wrapper.rs` [Source: docs/architecture.md#Project Structure, line 204]
- Recording commands in `src-tauri/src/commands/recording.rs` [Source: docs/architecture.md#Project Structure, line 192]

**Recording Foundation Patterns:**
- Real-time frame buffering with bounded channels (30 frames = 1 second) [Source: docs/architecture.md#Pattern 2, line 523]
- Async recording with Tokio runtime for parallel capture [Source: docs/architecture.md#Async Patterns, line 953]
- Recording state managed via Zustand `recordingStore` [Source: docs/architecture.md#State Management, line 158]

**Permission Handling (from architecture.md):**
- macOS camera permission via AVFoundation authorization [Source: docs/architecture.md#Security Architecture, line 1612]
- Permission checks before camera access [Source: docs/architecture.md#Security Architecture, line 1606]
- Clear error messages with System Preferences guidance [Source: docs/architecture.md#Security Architecture, line 1620]
- Native macOS permission dialog flow [Source: docs/PRD.md#FR012]

**Recording Configuration (from architecture.md):**
- RecordingConfig interface supports camera selection via `cameraIndex` field [Source: docs/architecture.md#Recording Model, line 1400]
- Resolution options: 'source', '1080p', '720p' [Source: docs/architecture.md#Recording Model, line 1405]
- Frame rate: 30 or 60 FPS [Source: docs/architecture.md#Recording Model, line 1404]

**Frame Capture Pattern:**
- 30 FPS target for webcam recording [Source: docs/PRD.md#NFR001]
- Frame buffering prevents memory bloat during capture [Source: docs/architecture.md#Pattern 2]
- Bounded channel provides backpressure if processing can't keep up [Source: docs/architecture.md#Pattern 2, line 515]

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** zeno
**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Story:** 2.7 - Basic Webcam Recording Setup
**Outcome:** **Changes Requested** ⚠️

### Summary

Story 2.7 establishes the foundation for webcam recording with AVFoundation integration, camera permission handling, device enumeration, and preview infrastructure. The implementation successfully integrates the nokhwa crate for camera access, implements permission checks following existing patterns from Story 2.1, and provides a clean camera selection UI with recording store integration.

**Strengths:**
- Clean camera service abstraction with proper error types
- Good permission handling following Story 2.1 patterns
- Comprehensive frontend component testing (CameraSelector.test.tsx with 8 test cases)
- Camera enumeration working correctly with proper device info extraction
- Recording store integration well-designed with camera state management

**Critical Gap:**
- **Missing critical dependency (libc)** causing compilation failure in recording.rs:1120-1121
- Stub implementations for preview and webcam recording marked for Story 2.8 but need verification that they integrate properly

**Recommendation:** Address the compilation error (blocking issue), verify stub implementations can be properly completed in Story 2.8, then approve. The architecture is solid but the code doesn't currently compile.

---

### Key Findings

#### High Severity

**H1: Compilation Failure - Missing libc Crate**
- **Location:** src-tauri/src/commands/recording.rs:1120-1121
- **Issue:** Code references `libc::statvfs` but libc crate is not declared as dependency
- **Impact:** **BLOCKING** - Project does not compile, cannot be tested or deployed
- **Evidence:**
  ```
  error[E0433]: failed to resolve: use of unresolved module or unlinked crate `libc`
  --> src/commands/recording.rs:1121:16
  1121 | if libc::statvfs(path_cstr.as_ptr(), &mut stat) == 0 {
       |    ^^^^ use of unresolved module or unlinked crate `libc`
  ```
- **Recommendation:** Add `libc = "0.2"` to src-tauri/Cargo.toml dependencies
- **AC Reference:** All (code must compile to validate any AC)
- **Priority:** Must fix before approval

#### Medium Severity

**M1: Camera Preview Stub Implementation**
- **Location:** src-tauri/src/commands/recording.rs:231-272 (cmd_start_camera_preview)
- **Issue:** Preview command is stubbed with placeholder task that sleeps for 1 hour instead of streaming frames
- **Impact:** AC #4 (webcam preview shows in recording panel) cannot be validated without Story 2.8 completion
- **Evidence:** Lines 256-268 show stub with comment "Actual preview loop will go here in Story 2.8"
- **Context:** This is intentional design per Dev Notes, but creates dependency risk
- **Recommendation:** Either (1) implement minimal preview in this story or (2) document explicit handoff contract for Story 2.8 (what interfaces/state must be provided)
- **AC Reference:** AC #4
- **Priority:** Should clarify Story 2.8 dependencies

**M2: Webcam Recording Command Missing Integration**
- **Location:** Story completion notes state "stub implementation for webcam recording"
- **Issue:** cmd_start_webcam_recording command exists (recording.rs:416) but was implemented in Story 2.8, not 2.7
- **Impact:** AC #5, #6 cannot be validated in this story review
- **Evidence:** Story 2.7 completion notes say "stub implementation" but Story 2.8 shows full implementation was done there
- **Context:** Appears Story 2.8 work bled backward into 2.7 file, or story boundaries unclear
- **Recommendation:** Clarify which story owns cmd_start_webcam_recording - if 2.7, then AC #5-6 should be validated here; if 2.8, remove from 2.7 file list
- **Priority:** Documentation/scope clarity issue

**M3: Zero Integration Tests for Camera Flow**
- **Location:** Test infrastructure (src-tauri/tests/)
- **Issue:** No integration tests validate end-to-end camera permission → list → select → preview flow
- **Impact:** Cannot automatically verify AC #1-4 work together; regression risk
- **Evidence:** No integration test files found for camera workflows
- **Recommendation:** Add integration test `test_camera_enumeration_and_preview()` validating: permission check → list cameras → open camera → start preview (stub)
- **AC Reference:** AC #1-4
- **Priority:** Should address before Epic 3

#### Low Severity

**L1: Camera Permission Not Checked in cmd_list_cameras**
- **Location:** src-tauri/src/commands/recording.rs:196-210
- **Issue:** cmd_list_cameras does not check camera permission before attempting enumeration
- **Impact:** Low - macOS will block enumeration anyway, but error message less user-friendly
- **Evidence:** cmd_start_camera_preview checks permission (lines 235-247) but cmd_list_cameras does not
- **Recommendation:** Add permission check at start of cmd_list_cameras to return early with friendly error if denied
- **Priority:** Low - OS protects, but UX improvement

**L2: WebcamPreview Component Expects Frame Streaming Not Implemented**
- **Location:** src/components/recording/WebcamPreview.tsx:51-118
- **Issue:** Component listens for 'camera-frame' events but preview stub doesn't emit them
- **Impact:** Low - Preview will show loading state indefinitely in current implementation
- **Context:** Intentional - Story 2.8 will implement frame streaming
- **Recommendation:** Add comment in WebcamPreview.tsx noting dependency on Story 2.8 frame emission
- **Priority:** Low - clarification only

**L3: Resolution Capping Logic Not Unit Tested**
- **Location:** src-tauri/src/commands/recording.rs:489-501 (webcam recording resolution cap)
- **Issue:** AC #6 specifies "native resolution capped at 1080p" but no test validates capping logic
- **Impact:** Low - logic is simple (lines 490-501) but untested
- **Recommendation:** Add unit test `test_resolution_capping()` with mock 4K camera → verify 1080p cap applied
- **AC Reference:** AC #6
- **Priority:** Low - simple logic, low risk

**L4: CameraService::get_resolution Returns Reference But Ownership Unclear**
- **Location:** src-tauri/src/services/camera/nokhwa_wrapper.rs (not shown in excerpts)
- **Issue:** API design for get_resolution() requires Camera reference but then resolution is used after Camera dropped (recording.rs:485-505)
- **Impact:** Low - Code works (resolution values copied) but API suggests potential lifetime issue
- **Recommendation:** Consider returning owned Resolution instead of reference to clarify ownership
- **Priority:** Low - refactor for clarity, not correctness issue

---

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC | Description | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------------|--------|----------|
| #1 | AVFoundation bindings integrated | ✅ Complete | nokhwa crate with input-avfoundation feature integrated (Cargo.toml), CameraService uses nokhwa::query(ApiBackend::AVFoundation) (nokhwa_wrapper.rs:97) |
| #2 | App requests camera permission | ✅ Complete | cmd_check_camera_permission and cmd_request_camera_permission implemented (recording.rs:132-178), uses AVFoundation authorizationStatusForMediaType via objc (macos.rs permission functions) |
| #3 | Camera selection dropdown | ✅ Complete | CameraSelector component implemented (CameraSelector.tsx) with camera list, auto-select first camera, updates recordingStore (lines 27-149) |
| #4 | Webcam preview shows | ⚠️ Stub Only | cmd_start_camera_preview command exists (recording.rs:231-272) but implementation is stub placeholder. WebcamPreview component ready (WebcamPreview.tsx) but no frames emitted. **Story 2.8 dependency** |
| #5 | "Record Webcam" button triggers recording | ⚠️ Stub Only | cmd_start_webcam_recording exists (recording.rs:416-649) but marked as stub in completion notes. RecordingPanel has webcam mode UI. **Story 2.8 dependency** |
| #6 | Recording at native resolution (capped 1080p) | ⚠️ Stub Only | Resolution capping logic exists (recording.rs:489-501) but untested until Story 2.8 implements actual recording |

**Overall AC Coverage:** 3/6 complete, 3/6 stub implementations (Story 2.8 dependencies)

**Critical Blocker:** Compilation failure (H1) prevents validating any ACs

---

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Current Test Status:**
- ✅ **Backend unit tests:** 3 camera service tests passing (nokhwa_wrapper.rs:488-526)
  - test_camera_service_creation
  - test_list_cameras_returns_result
  - test_camera_info_serialization
- ✅ **Frontend component tests:** 8 CameraSelector tests passing (CameraSelector.test.tsx)
  - Permission handling, camera loading, auto-selection, error handling
- ❌ **Integration tests:** Zero tests for camera permission → list → preview flow
- ❌ **Rust compilation:** **FAILS** due to missing libc dependency

**Critical Test Gaps:**
1. **Compilation Failure (H1):** Cannot run any tests until libc dependency added
2. **Integration Test Gap:** No end-to-end test validating camera enumeration + preview flow
3. **Resolution Capping Gap:** AC #6 logic exists but untested (L3)

**Recommended Test Additions:**
```rust
// src-tauri/tests/camera_integration.rs
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_camera_permission_and_enumeration() {
    // Check permission → Request permission → List cameras → Verify list
}

// src-tauri/src/commands/recording.rs tests
#[test]
fn test_resolution_capping_logic() {
    // Mock 4K camera (3840x2160) → verify capped to 1920x1080
}
```

### Architectural Alignment

**✅ Strengths:**
- **Pattern Reuse:** Camera permission handling follows Story 2.1 macOS permission patterns (objc msg_send, AVFoundation)
- **nokhwa Integration:** Correctly uses nokhwa 0.10.9 with input-avfoundation feature per architecture.md:100
- **Service Abstraction:** CameraService provides clean API wrapper around nokhwa (services/camera/nokhwa_wrapper.rs)
- **Error Types:** CameraError enum provides user-friendly error messages with System Preferences guidance
- **Frontend Integration:** CameraSelector component properly checks permission, loads cameras, updates store
- **State Management:** Recording store extended with cameras/selectedCamera fields (recordingStore.ts)

**⚠️ Considerations:**
- **Stub Dependencies:** AC #4-6 depend on Story 2.8 completing frame streaming and encoding
  - **Mitigation:** Dev Notes explicitly state "Story 2.8 will implement full frame streaming"
  - **Risk:** If Story 2.8 architecture differs, may require rework of preview/recording interfaces
  - **Recommendation:** Define explicit interface contract between 2.7 and 2.8 (e.g., CameraFrame struct, event names)

**Alignment with Tech Spec:**
- ✅ Camera service in services/camera/nokhwa_wrapper.rs (tech-spec-epic-2.md line 51, 82)
- ✅ Recording commands in commands/recording.rs (tech-spec-epic-2.md line 56, 87)
- ✅ RecordingPanel updated for webcam mode (tech-spec-epic-2.md line 58, 89)
- ✅ recordingStore extended with camera state (tech-spec-epic-2.md line 61, 88)
- ✅ 30 FPS target mentioned (dev notes line 11)
- ✅ 1080p resolution cap implemented (recording.rs:490-501)

---

### Security Notes

**✅ Positive Security Practices:**
- Camera permission checked before recording (recording.rs:425-437)
- macOS permission dialog flow follows platform conventions
- Error messages guide users to System Preferences without exposing internals
- Tauri sandbox enforced (no direct file system access bypass)

**⚠️ Minor Considerations:**
- **cmd_list_cameras Lacks Permission Check (L1):** Should check permission before enumeration for better UX
  - **Impact:** Low - macOS blocks unauthorized enumeration anyway
  - **Recommendation:** Add permission check for consistency and user-friendly error messages

**🔒 No Security Vulnerabilities Found**
