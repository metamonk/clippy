## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

Multi-track video compositing is implemented as part of the **Hybrid Smart Segment Pre-Rendering** architecture (ADR-008). This story completes the composition renderer by adding video track layering to complement the audio mixing implemented in Story 5.5.

**Segment Classification:**
- Multi-track video segments are classified as **Complex Segments**
- Requires FFmpeg pre-rendering to cache (cannot play multiple videos directly in MPV)
- Cache key includes track structure hash for proper invalidation

**Technical Approach:**

**FFmpeg Overlay Filter Chain:**
```bash
# Example: 3 video tracks (Track 1 = bottom, Track 3 = top)
ffmpeg \
  -i track1_clip.mp4 \  # Base layer
  -i track2_clip.mp4 \  # Middle layer
  -i track3_clip.mp4 \  # Top layer
  -filter_complex "\
    [0:v]scale=1920:1080:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,\
         pad=1920:1080:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2:black[v0]; \
    [1:v]scale=640:360:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease[v1]; \
    [2:v]scale=640:360:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease[v2]; \
    [v0][v1]overlay=x=100:y=100:format=auto:alpha=auto[tmp1]; \
    [tmp1][v2]overlay=x=W-w-100:y=100:format=auto:alpha=auto[vout] \
  " \
  -map "[vout]" \
  output.mp4
```

**Key Implementation Points:**

1. **Layer Order:** Overlay filters applied in sequence from bottom to top
2. **Scaling:** Each track scaled independently with aspect ratio preservation
3. **Positioning:** overlay filter x/y parameters from clip position properties
4. **Alpha/Opacity:** `format=auto:alpha=auto` enables transparency support
5. **Black Background:** Generated via `pad` filter when no bottom track clip

### Performance Considerations

**Target:** 60 FPS with 3 simultaneous video tracks on MacBook Pro 2020+

**Optimization Strategies:**

1. **Hardware Acceleration:**
   - Use VideoToolbox encoder on macOS: `-c:v h264_videotoolbox`
   - GPU-accelerated overlay filter: `overlay_videotoolbox`
   - Reduces CPU usage from 150% to 40-60% for 3-track composition

2. **Encoding Settings:**
   - Preset: `ultrafast` for real-time encoding
   - CRF: 23 (good quality, fast encode)
   - Profile: `high` (supports B-frames, better compression)

3. **Adaptive Quality:**
   - Monitor frame rate during playback
   - If <30 FPS, reduce resolution or quality automatically
   - Log warning for user to enable hardware acceleration

4. **Cache Strategy:**
   - Pre-render complex segments in background
   - Decode-ahead buffer: 2 segments (~20s)
   - LRU eviction when cache exceeds 1GB

### Project Structure Notes

**Files to Modify:**

- `src-tauri/src/services/segment_renderer.rs` - Add multi-track overlay filter generation
- `src-tauri/src/services/composition_analyzer.rs` - Detect multi-track video segments
- `src-tauri/src/models/timeline.rs` - Add clip position/scale/opacity properties
- `src/stores/compositionStore.ts` - Track multi-track composition state
- `src/types/timeline.ts` - Add ClipTransform interface

**New Files:**

- None (extends existing SegmentRenderer implementation)

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests (Rust):**
- Filter graph generation with 2, 3, and 4+ tracks
- Scaling calculations with various resolutions (1080p, 720p, 4K, portrait)
- Aspect ratio preservation logic
- Position/scale transform calculations
- Black background canvas generation

**Integration Tests (Rust + TypeScript):**
- End-to-end multi-track composition rendering
- Performance benchmarks with 3+ tracks
- Cache invalidation on track structure changes
- Playback seamlessness across segments

**Manual Testing:**
- Visual verification of PiP positioning
- Alpha channel transparency validation
- Frame rate monitoring with 3+ tracks
- Resolution mismatch handling

### Technical Challenges

**Challenge 1: Real-Time Multi-Track Compositing Performance**

Multi-track overlay filter chains are computationally expensive. Hardware acceleration is critical to meet 60 FPS target.

**Solution:**
- Enable VideoToolbox hardware encoder on macOS
- Use `overlay_videotoolbox` GPU-accelerated filter
- Fallback to software encoding with quality reduction if hardware unavailable
- Pre-render complex segments so playback is lightweight (only MPV decode)

**Challenge 2: Variable Resolution Handling**

Timeline may contain clips with different resolutions (1080p, 720p, portrait, landscape). FFmpeg must scale each track to canvas size while preserving aspect ratio.

**Solution:**
- Calculate canvas size from timeline settings (default 1920x1080)
- Apply `scale` filter with `force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease`
- Use `pad` filter to letterbox/pillarbox smaller clips
- Store scaled dimensions in filter graph for overlay positioning

**Challenge 3: Alpha Channel Transparency**

Some clips may have alpha channels (PNG sequences, greenscreen-keyed video). Overlay filter must support transparency for layering effects.

**Solution:**
- Use `format=auto:alpha=auto` in overlay filter
- Detect alpha channel presence during metadata extraction
- Apply appropriate pixel format (yuva420p) when alpha present
- Test with semi-transparent overlays (opacity < 100%)

- Segment struct contains video_layers, start_time, duration, canvas_size as specified

**Pattern Reuse:**
- Extends FFmpeg overlay filter pattern from Story 4.6 (FFmpegCompositor) ✅
- Reuses ClipTransform pattern for PiP positioning ✅
- Consistent with ADR-008 segment classification rules ✅

**Type Consistency:**
- TypeScript ClipTransform (timeline.ts:16-25) matches Rust ClipTransform (timeline.rs:20-38) ✅
- Track.trackNumber added to both TS and Rust ✅
- Proper serde serialization with camelCase for cross-language compatibility ✅

### Security Notes

No security concerns identified. Code performs:
