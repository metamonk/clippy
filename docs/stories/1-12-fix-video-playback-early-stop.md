# Story 1.12: Fix Video Playback Early Stop

Status: review

## Story

As a user,
I want videos to play to their true end position,
so that I can see all frames including the final second of content.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Video plays to 100% of duration (e.g., 0:05 / 0:05)
2. Last frame visible before playback stops
3. Time display shows complete duration when stopped
4. Fix works across all codecs (H.264, HEVC, ProRes, VP9)
5. No regression in existing playback behavior
6. Root cause documented in code comments or ADR
7. Tests verify playback reaches true end

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Add diagnostic logging to identify root cause (AC: 1, 2, 6)
  - [x] Log MPV time-pos, time-remaining, duration properties during playback
  - [x] Log when playback stops vs when duration indicates end

  - [x] Check if container metadata inflates duration (trailing data)
  - [x] Test frame-accurate duration calculation
  - [x] Document findings in code comments

- [x] Adjust time polling interval if needed (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Current: 100ms polling (VideoPlayer.tsx:171)

  - [x] Measure impact on performance (CPU usage)
  - [x] Determine if polling interval affects early stop detection

- [x] Implement fix based on root cause analysis (AC: 1, 2, 3, 5)
  - [x] Apply configuration changes or duration adjustments
  - [x] Update MPV service or VideoPlayer as needed
  - [x] Ensure playback state correctly detects true end
  - [x] Verify time display shows 100% completion

- [x] Write regression tests (AC: 5, 7)
  - [x] Unit test: Verify playback reaches duration within tolerance
  - [x] Integration test: Load video, play to end, verify currentTime >= duration - 0.1s
  - [x] Test for each codec format
  - [x] Ensure existing playback tests still pass
  - [x] Add CI test to prevent regression

- [x] Verify no regression in existing behavior (AC: 5)

  - [x] Manual test: Video loading still works for all codecs
  - [x] Manual test: Time display updates correctly during playback

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Current Issue (TD-004):**

When playing videos in the MPV-based player, playback stops approximately 1 second before the actual end. The time display shows something like "0:04 / 0:05" when playback stops, preventing users from seeing the final second of video content.

**Priority:** Low (cosmetic issue, doesn't block core functionality)

**Technology Stack:**
- **Video Player:** MPV via libmpv2 v5.0.1 (headless mode: `vo=null`)
- **Backend Service:** `src-tauri/src/services/mpv_player.rs`
- **Frontend:** React 19 + VideoPlayer.tsx + PlayerControls.tsx
- **State Management:** Zustand playerStore

**Hypotheses for Root Cause:**

1. **MPV keep-open Behavior:**
   - Current setting: `keep-open=yes` (mpv_player.rs:27)
   - May stop playback early to avoid EndFile event
   - Solution: Try `keep-open=always` or adjust EndFile handling

2. **Duration Calculation Issue:**
   - MPV duration property may not match actual playable content
   - Some codecs have trailing metadata inflating duration
   - Solution: Compare `duration` vs `time-remaining` vs `playtime-remaining` properties

3. **Frame Capture Polling Interval:**
   - Current: 100ms polling for time updates (VideoPlayer.tsx:171)
   - May detect "near end" state prematurely
   - Solution: Reduce to 33ms (30fps frame-accurate)

4. **Pause-on-End Logic:**
   - VideoPlayer may have logic pausing near end
   - Check trim boundary enforcement (lines 185-193)
   - Solution: Review pause conditions

**Files to Investigate:**

```
src-tauri/src/
└── services/
    └── mpv_player.rs:27           [keep-open setting]

src/
└── components/
    └── player/
        └── VideoPlayer.tsx:171    [Time polling interval]
        └── VideoPlayer.tsx:185-193 [Trim boundary constraints]
```

**Debug Approach:**

1. **Add Comprehensive Logging** (15 min)
   ```rust
   // In mpv_player.rs get_time()
   let time = mpv.get_property::<f64>("time-pos")?;
   let remaining = mpv.get_property::<f64>("time-remaining").ok();
   let playtime_remaining = mpv.get_property::<f64>("playtime-remaining").ok();
   debug!("[MPV] time-pos: {}, remaining: {:?}, playtime: {:?}, duration: {}",
          time, remaining, playtime_remaining, duration);
   ```

2. **Test Different keep-open Values** (15 min)
   - Try: `keep-open=always`
   - Try: Remove `keep-open` entirely
   - Monitor EndFile events

3. **Compare Duration Properties** (15 min)
   ```rust
   let duration = mpv.get_property::<f64>("duration")?;
   let length = mpv.get_property::<f64>("length").ok();
   debug!("[MPV] duration: {}, length: {:?}", duration, length);
   ```

4. **Adjust Polling Interval** (15 min)
   - Change from 100ms to 33ms
   - Monitor performance impact
   - Check if issue persists

**Expected Resolution Time:** ~1 hour

**Testing Requirements:**
- Test with all codecs: H.264, HEVC, ProRes, VP9
- Test with different video lengths (5s, 30s, 60s clips)
- Verify last frame visible
- Confirm time display shows 100% (e.g., 0:05 / 0:05)
- No regression in playback, seek, or loading

**Performance Considerations:**

From PRD NFR001:
- Video playback must maintain 30+ FPS
- No impact to playback smoothness

Optimization strategies:
- If reducing polling interval, monitor CPU usage
- Ensure fix doesn't introduce playback stuttering
- Consider event-based end detection instead of polling

**Codec Behavior Notes (from Story 1.4):**

Verified codecs:
- H.264/AVC (MP4) ✅
- HEVC/H.265 yuv420p (MP4) ✅
- VP9 (WebM) ✅
- ProRes (MOV) ✅

Some codecs may have trailing metadata:
- ProRes often includes metadata tracks
- WebM container may have index data at end
- MP4 moov atom placement varies

### Project Structure Notes

**Files to Modify:**

```
src-tauri/src/
├── services/
│   └── mpv_player.rs              [UPDATE: keep-open setting, duration logging]

src/
└── components/
    └── player/
        └── VideoPlayer.tsx        [INVESTIGATE: polling interval, end detection]
```

**No New Files Expected** - This is a bug fix, not a feature addition.

**Testing Files:**

```
src/components/player/
└── VideoPlayer.test.tsx           [UPDATE: Add end-of-playback tests]

src-tauri/src/services/
└── mpv_player.rs                  [ADD: Inline tests for duration accuracy]
```

**Naming Conventions:**
- Rust: snake_case functions, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- TypeScript: camelCase for variables/functions
- Comments: Document the "why" not the "what"

### Completion Notes List

**Root Cause Identified:**

The issue was a **display rounding problem**, not an actual playback issue:

1. **Backend Behavior:** MPV correctly plays to the last video frame (~4.967s for 5s videos). The 33ms discrepancy between the last frame (4.967s) and container duration (5.000s) is normal for digital video.

2. **Display Issue:** The `formatTime()` function used `Math.floor()` to round seconds:
   - 4.967s → Math.floor(4.967) = 4s → displayed as "0:04"
   - 5.000s → Math.floor(5.000) = 5s → displayed as "0:05"
   - Result: Users saw "0:04 / 0:05" and perceived playback stopped 1 second early

**Solution Implemented:**

Changed `formatTime()` from `Math.floor()` to `Math.round()` in `src/lib/utils/timeUtils.ts`:
- 4.967s → Math.round(4.967) = 5s → displays as "0:05"
- Now shows "0:05 / 0:05" correctly

**Additional Changes:**
- Changed MPV `keep-open` setting from "yes" to "always" (no functional difference observed)
- Added diagnostic logging to `get_time()` and `get_duration()` for future debugging
- Fixed TypeScript error in test setup (global → globalThis)

**Testing:**
- All codecs (H.264, HEVC, ProRes, VP9) reach 99%+ completion (4.967s / 5.000s)
- Created comprehensive regression test `test_playback_reaches_end()` testing all codecs
- Updated timeUtils tests to verify rounding fix (TD-004 specific test added)
- All 26 backend tests pass
- Frontend timeUtils tests pass (31 tests total)
