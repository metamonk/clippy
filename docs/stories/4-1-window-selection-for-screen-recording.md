# Story 4.1: Window Selection for Screen Recording

Status: review

## Story

As a user,
I want to record a specific application window instead of the full screen,
So that I can focus recordings on relevant content without showing my entire desktop.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Recording panel shows "Full Screen" vs "Window" recording mode toggle
2. Window mode displays list of open application windows to choose from
3. ScreenCaptureKit SCContentFilter configured to capture selected window only
4. Window recording captures window content at native resolution
5. Recording follows window if it moves (or maintains fixed capture area - document choice)
6. Window selection persists for subsequent recordings in session
7. Clear error if selected window closes during recording

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Add window recording mode to RecordingConfig model (AC: #1)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Update `RecordingConfig` interface in `src/types/recording.ts` to add `recordingMode: 'fullscreen' | 'window'` field (default 'fullscreen')

  - [ ] Subtask 7.5: Integration test: Window recording captures correct window content (visual verification)
  - [ ] Subtask 7.6: Integration test: Recording stops gracefully when window closes
  - [ ] Subtask 7.7: E2E test: Full workflow from window selection to successful recording

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Recording Mode Architecture:**
- Extends existing `RecordingConfig` model from Story 2.1-2.3 foundation
- Recording mode is a configuration parameter, not a separate recording type
- Window selection is optional - only required when `recordingMode === 'window'`
- Session state persistence uses Zustand store, not permanent storage

**ScreenCaptureKit Integration:**
- Window enumeration via `SCShareableContent.getExcludingDesktopWindows(excludedApps: [], onScreenWindowsOnly: true)`
- Window filter via `SCContentFilter.initWithDesktopIndependentWindow(window)`
- Window tracking behavior determined by filter type (follow vs fixed) - **Decision Required**
- Native resolution detection: Use window bounds from `SCWindow` metadata
- Error handling: ScreenCaptureKit emits stream errors when window is invalid

**Follow Window vs Fixed Capture Decision:**
- **Recommended: Follow Window**
  - Pros: Better UX, window can move without breaking recording, matches user expectations
  - Cons: May capture window decorations (title bar, borders), slight performance overhead
  - Implementation: ScreenCaptureKit handles automatically with `initWithDesktopIndependentWindow`
- **Alternative: Fixed Capture**
  - Pros: Predictable output size, excludes window decorations if carefully positioned
  - Cons: Window movement breaks recording (captures empty space), requires manual region calculation
  - Implementation: Use `initWithDisplay` with custom rect bounds
- **Default to Follow Window** for Story 4.1 implementation, document as architectural decision

**Window Selection UX:**
- Display window title and app name: "{appName} - {windowTitle}"
- Group by application if multiple windows from same app
- Show preview thumbnail if available from ScreenCaptureKit window snapshots
- Disable recording button until window is selected in window mode
- Show warning icon if selected window is minimized or off-screen

**Error Handling:**
- Window closed during recording: Stop recording, save partial file, notify user
- Window minimized: ScreenCaptureKit should continue capturing (test behavior)
- Window moved off-screen: ScreenCaptureKit should continue capturing (test behavior)
- No windows available: Disable window mode, show informative message

**Performance Considerations:**
- Window enumeration is synchronous but fast (<100ms typical)
- Cache window list for 5 seconds to avoid excessive ScreenCaptureKit calls
- Window capture has similar performance to fullscreen (both use ScreenCaptureKit streams)
- Window tracking adds negligible overhead if using `Follow Window` approach

### Source Tree Components to Touch

**Frontend (TypeScript/React):**
- `src/types/recording.ts` - Add recordingMode and selectedWindowId to RecordingConfig, create WindowInfo interface
- `src/components/recording/RecordingPanel.tsx` - Add recording mode toggle UI
- `src/components/recording/WindowSelector.tsx` (NEW) - Window selection dropdown/list component
- `src/components/recording/RecordingModeToggle.tsx` (NEW) - "Full Screen" vs "Window" toggle component
- `src/stores/recordingStore.ts` - Add recording mode and window selection state management
- `src/lib/tauri/recording.ts` - Add `getAvailableWindows()` wrapper for Tauri command

**Backend (Rust):**
- `src-tauri/src/models/recording.rs` - Add recording_mode and selected_window_id fields to RecordingConfig struct
- `src-tauri/src/commands/recording.rs` - Add `cmd_get_available_windows` Tauri command
- `src-tauri/src/services/screen_capture/screencapturekit.rs` - Update to accept window mode, create window-specific filters
- `src-tauri/src/services/screen_capture/mod.rs` - Add WindowInfo struct for window metadata

**Tests:**
- `src/components/recording/WindowSelector.test.tsx` (NEW) - Window selection component tests
- `src/components/recording/RecordingModeToggle.test.tsx` (NEW) - Mode toggle tests
- `src/stores/recordingStore.test.ts` - Recording mode state management tests
- `tests/e2e/4.1-window-recording.spec.ts` (NEW) - E2E workflow test

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**
- Builds on Epic 2 recording infrastructure (Stories 2.1-2.3)
- Follows established ScreenCaptureKit integration patterns from Story 2.1
- Consistent with RecordingConfig extension pattern (similar to audio source selection in Story 2.4)
- Recording UI components follow existing pattern in `src/components/recording/`
- State management follows Zustand patterns in `src/stores/recordingStore.ts`

**Detected Conflicts or Variances:**
- None - Window mode is an additive feature to existing recording infrastructure
- ScreenCaptureKit filter creation logic will have conditional branching (fullscreen vs window filter)
- Recording validation must check window mode and selected window before starting
- UI layout in RecordingPanel may need expansion to accommodate window selector

**Lessons Learned from Story 2.1 (ScreenCaptureKit Setup):**
- ScreenCaptureKit permissions already handled (screen recording permission covers window capture)
- macOS permission prompts can be intrusive - inform user before triggering
- ScreenCaptureKit error handling is crucial - framework can fail silently
- Window list enumeration should exclude system UI and hidden windows for better UX

**Lessons Learned from Story 2.4 (Audio Source Selection):**
- Dropdown UI for source selection works well in RecordingPanel
- Session persistence of user preferences improves workflow
- Configuration validation before recording start prevents runtime errors
- Clear error messages when selected source is unavailable

**Lessons Learned from Story 3.10 (Audio Fade):**
- Optional configuration fields maintain backward compatibility
- Session state in Zustand stores effective for transient preferences
- UI components can coexist in constrained timeline/panel spaces
- Validation utilities (like validateFadeDuration) prevent invalid configurations

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

### Reviewer: zeno
### Date: 2025-10-29
### Outcome: Changes Requested

### Summary

Story 4.1 implements window selection for screen recording with substantial completion of core functionality. The implementation demonstrates solid engineering with proper ScreenCaptureKit integration, comprehensive unit tests, and clean architecture. However, there are notable gaps in AC #7 (window closure notification) and missing integration/E2E tests that should be addressed before final approval.

**Overall Assessment:** Implementation is 85-90% complete with strong technical quality. The missing pieces are primarily polish items (user notification, test coverage) rather than fundamental architectural concerns.

### Key Findings

#### High Severity
None

#### Medium Severity

**M-1: ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-29) - AC #7 Incomplete - Missing Window Closure Notification [Priority: Medium]**
- **Location:** `src-tauri/src/services/screen_capture/screencapturekit.rs:729-738`
- **Issue:** Window closure detection exists (3-second timeout monitoring) but no user-facing toast notification when window closes during recording (Subtask 6.4 incomplete)
- **Resolution:** Backend now emits "window-closed" event (screencapturekit.rs:738), frontend displays error toast and gracefully saves partial recording (RecordingPanel.tsx:157-192)
- **Implementation:** Added app_handle parameter threading through capture service, event listener in RecordingPanel with proper cleanup
- **Files:** screencapturekit.rs:738, RecordingPanel.tsx:157-192

**M-2: Missing Integration and E2E Tests [Priority: Medium]**
- **Location:** Tests directory
- **Issue:** Subtasks 7.4-7.7 incomplete - no integration or E2E tests for window recording flow
- **Impact:** Reduced confidence in window capture behavior, window closure handling, and cross-layer integration
- **Current Coverage:** Unit tests exist for WindowSelector and recordingStore (excellent coverage)
- **Missing Tests:**
  - Integration: `cmd_get_available_windows` returns valid window list
  - Integration: Window recording captures correct window content
  - Integration: Recording stops gracefully when window closes
  - E2E: Full workflow from window selection to successful recording
- **Recommendation:** Add at least integration tests for window enumeration and closure scenarios

**M-3: useEffect Dependency Array Issue [Priority: Low]**
- **Location:** `src/components/recording/WindowSelector.tsx:33-35`
- **Issue:** `handleRefresh` called in useEffect without being in dependency array
- **Impact:** ESLint warnings, potential stale closure bugs
- **Current Code:**
  ```typescript
  useEffect(() => {
    handleRefresh();
  }, []); // Missing handleRefresh in deps
  ```
- **Recommendation:** Either add `handleRefresh` to deps with useCallback, or inline the refresh logic

#### Low Severity

**L-1: Radix UI Pattern Concern [Priority: Low]**
- **Location:** `src/components/recording/WindowSelector.tsx:132-148`
- **Issue:** Using `<optgroup>` inside Radix UI `<SelectContent>` - may not be the correct pattern
- **Impact:** Potential rendering issues or accessibility concerns with Radix UI Select component
- **Recommendation:** Verify Radix UI documentation for grouping pattern; consider using separate `SelectGroup` components if needed

**L-2: ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-29) - Partial Recording Save Not Implemented [Priority: Low]**
- **Location:** Subtask 6.5
- **Issue:** When window closes during recording, partial recording save logic not implemented
- **Impact:** User loses entire recording if window accidentally closed
- **Resolution:** Event handler now calls handleStopRecording() to gracefully save partial recording (RecordingPanel.tsx:172-180)
- **Expected Behavior:** Save partial recording if frames captured, or explicitly discard with user notification - ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC # | Requirement | Status | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Recording panel shows "Full Screen" vs "Window" toggle | ✅ Complete | RecordingPanel.tsx:449-457 |
| 2 | Window mode displays list of windows to choose from | ✅ Complete | WindowSelector component with search, grouping, refresh |
| 3 | ScreenCaptureKit configured for selected window only | ✅ Complete | screencapturekit.rs:566-595 with `with_desktop_independent_window()` |
| 4 | Window recording captures at native resolution | ✅ Complete | Native ScreenCaptureKit behavior |
| 5 | Recording follows window if it moves | ✅ Complete | "Follow Window" approach documented and implemented |
| 6 | Window selection persists for session | ✅ Complete | recordingStore.ts with `lastSelectedWindowId` |
| 7 | Clear error if window closes during recording | ✅ Complete | Detection + toast notification + partial save (Task 6 - 2025-10-29) |

**Overall AC Coverage: 7/7 Complete**

### Test Coverage and Gaps

#### Existing Tests (✅ Excellent)
- **WindowSelector.test.tsx:** 6 comprehensive unit tests
  - Window list rendering
  - Selection handling
  - Empty state
  - Refresh functionality
  - Search for >10 windows
  - Hidden window handling
- **recordingStore.test.ts:** Window selection state management tests
  - Mode switching
  - Session persistence (AC #6)
  - Window restoration

#### Missing Tests (❌ See M-2)
- Integration tests for window enumeration
- Integration tests for window capture
- Integration tests for window closure detection
- E2E workflow tests

**Test Coverage Assessment:** Strong unit test coverage, weak integration/E2E coverage

### Architectural Alignment

✅ **Strengths:**
- Follows established ScreenCaptureKit integration patterns from Story 2.1
- Consistent with RecordingConfig extension pattern (Story 2.4)
- Clean separation: Rust backend (window enumeration, capture) ↔ TypeScript frontend (UI, state)
- Zustand store pattern maintained for session state
- Proper use of Optional types (`Option<u32>`, `selectedWindowId?: number`)

✅ **Architectural Decision Documented:**
- "Follow Window" approach chosen over "Fixed Capture" with clear rationale in Dev Notes

⚠️ **Minor Concerns:**
- No architectural issues, implementation aligns well with existing patterns

### Security Notes

✅ **No security concerns identified**
- Screen recording permission already handled (Story 2.1)
- Window enumeration uses safe ScreenCaptureKit APIs
- No user input validation risks (window IDs are system-provided)
- No injection vulnerabilities

### Best-Practices and References

**Relevant Technologies Detected:**
- **Backend:** Rust, ScreenCaptureKit (macOS), Tauri commands
- **Frontend:** TypeScript, React, Zustand, Radix UI, Vitest

**Best Practices Applied:**
- ✅ Proper error handling in window enumeration (src-tauri/src/commands/recording.rs:1380-1384)
