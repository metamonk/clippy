## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Current State (Story 3.2 Complete):**
- Multi-clip sequencing implemented with gap detection
- Clips can be positioned manually via drag within a single track
- TimelineClip supports horizontal dragging for repositioning
- Collision detection prevents overlapping clips on same track
- Track state managed in Zustand timelineStore with immutable updates

**Story 3.3 Goal:**
Enable users to drag clips vertically between tracks, maintaining their timeline position while reorganizing the composition layer structure. This is essential for flexible editing workflows and sets foundation for split/delete operations in subsequent stories.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend Framework:** React 19 + TypeScript
- **Canvas Library:** Konva.js (react-konva wrapper)
- **State Management:** Zustand (timelineStore)
- **Video Player:** MPV via libmpv2 (headless mode)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

**Key Architecture Patterns:**

From architecture.md (lines 847-930):
- Zustand immutable state updates with selectors
- Konva.js drag-and-drop API for clip manipulation
- Single MPV instance for playback (mode-aware: preview vs timeline)

**Data Model:**

Current Clip and Track models remain unchanged from Story 3.2:

```typescript
interface Clip {
  id: string;              // UUID
  filePath: string;
  startTime: number;       // Position on timeline (ms) - MUST REMAIN UNCHANGED when moving tracks
  duration: number;        // Total clip duration (ms)
  trimIn: number;          // Trim start point (ms)
  trimOut: number;         // Trim end point (ms)
}

interface Track {
  id: string;
  trackNumber: number;
  clips: Clip[];
  trackType: 'video' | 'audio';
  label?: string;
  isVisible?: boolean;
}
```

**Key Implementation Patterns:**

**1. Inter-Track Drag Detection:**

Konva.js drag events provide both X and Y positions. Current implementation (Story 3.2) only handles horizontal (X) dragging within a track. Story 3.3 adds vertical (Y) detection to identify target track:

```typescript
// In TimelineClip.tsx
function handleDragMove(e: KonvaEventObject<DragEvent>) {
  const mouseY = e.target.getStage()?.getPointerPosition()?.y ?? 0;

  // Calculate which track the clip is over based on Y position
  const targetTrackIndex = Math.floor(mouseY / TRACK_HEIGHT);
  const targetTrack = tracks[targetTrackIndex];

  // Show visual feedback on target track
  setHoveredTrackId(targetTrack?.id ?? null);
}

function handleDragEnd(e: KonvaEventObject<DragEvent>) {
  const mouseY = e.target.getStage()?.getPointerPosition()?.y ?? 0;
  const targetTrackIndex = Math.floor(mouseY / TRACK_HEIGHT);
  const targetTrack = tracks[targetTrackIndex];

  if (targetTrack && targetTrack.id !== currentTrack.id) {
    // Inter-track move detected
    moveClipToTrack(clip.id, targetTrack.id);
  } else {
    // Intra-track move (horizontal repositioning - existing logic)
    moveClip(clip.id, newStartTime);
  }
}
```

**2. Clip Transfer Logic:**

New Zustand action to move clip between tracks while preserving startTime:

```typescript
// In timelineStore.ts
moveClipToTrack: (clipId: string, targetTrackId: string) =>
  set((state) => {
    // Find source track and clip
    const sourceTrack = state.tracks.find(t =>
      t.clips.some(c => c.id === clipId)
    );
    const clip = sourceTrack?.clips.find(c => c.id === clipId);

    if (!sourceTrack || !clip) return state;

    // Check for collision on target track at clip's timeline position
    const targetTrack = state.tracks.find(t => t.id === targetTrackId);
    if (!targetTrack) return state;

    const hasCollision = targetTrack.clips.some(existingClip => {
      const clipEnd = clip.startTime + (clip.trimOut - clip.trimIn);
      const existingEnd = existingClip.startTime +
        (existingClip.trimOut - existingClip.trimIn);

      return !(clipEnd <= existingClip.startTime ||
               clip.startTime >= existingEnd);
    });

    if (hasCollision) {
      console.warn('Cannot move clip: collision detected on target track');
      return state; // Reject move
    }

    // Record history for undo
    recordHistory(state);

    // Remove from source track, add to target track
    return {
      tracks: state.tracks.map(track => {
        if (track.id === sourceTrack.id) {
          return {
            ...track,
            clips: track.clips.filter(c => c.id !== clipId)
          };
        } else if (track.id === targetTrackId) {
          return {
            ...track,
            clips: [...track.clips, clip].sort((a, b) => a.startTime - b.startTime)
          };
        }
        return track;
      })
    };
  })
```

**3. Undo System Implementation:**

Simple history stack (last 10 states) for basic undo capability:

```typescript
// In timelineStore.ts
interface TimelineStore {
  tracks: Track[];
  history: TimelineState[]; // Stack of previous states
  historyIndex: number;     // Current position in history

  // ... existing actions

  undo: () => void;
  recordHistory: (state: TimelineState) => void;
}

const MAX_HISTORY = 10;

export const useTimelineStore = create<TimelineStore>()(
  devtools(
    (set, get) => ({
      // ... existing state
      history: [],
      historyIndex: -1,

      recordHistory: (state: TimelineState) => {
        const currentHistory = get().history;
        const historyIndex = get().historyIndex;

        // Truncate forward history if we've undone and then made a new change
        const newHistory = currentHistory.slice(0, historyIndex + 1);

        // Add current state to history
        newHistory.push({ tracks: state.tracks });

        // Limit to MAX_HISTORY
        if (newHistory.length > MAX_HISTORY) {
          newHistory.shift();
        }

        set({
          history: newHistory,
          historyIndex: newHistory.length - 1
        });
      },

      undo: () => set((state) => {
        if (state.historyIndex <= 0) {
          console.warn('No more actions to undo');
          return state;
        }

        const previousState = state.history[state.historyIndex - 1];

        return {
          tracks: previousState.tracks,
          historyIndex: state.historyIndex - 1
        };
      })
    })
  )
);
```

**4. Visual Drag Feedback:**

Track highlight during drag-over using Konva.js visual cues:

```typescript
// In TimelineTrack.tsx
<Group>
  {/* Track background with highlight */}
  <Rect
    x={0}
    y={trackY}
    width={TIMELINE_WIDTH}
    height={TRACK_HEIGHT}
    fill={isHovered ? '#fef3c7' : '#1f2937'} // Highlight when hovered during drag
    stroke={isHovered ? '#f59e0b' : '#374151'}
    strokeWidth={isHovered ? 3 : 1}
  />

  {/* Drop zone indicator */}
  {isHovered && canDrop && (
    <Text
      x={10}
      y={trackY + TRACK_HEIGHT / 2}
      text="Drop here"
      fill="#f59e0b"
      fontSize={14}
    />
  )}

  {/* Cannot drop indicator */}
  {isHovered && !canDrop && (
    <Text
      x={10}
      y={trackY + TRACK_HEIGHT / 2}
      text="Cannot drop here (collision)"
      fill="#ef4444"
      fontSize={14}
    />
  )}

  {/* Clips rendered here */}
</Group>
```

**Lessons Learned from Story 3.2:**

From Story 3.2 Dev Agent Record:
- Zustand immutable updates work well for complex state changes
- Collision detection prevents invalid states
- Gap detection pattern can be reused for track collision checking
- 34 unit tests in clipOperations.ts provide strong foundation

Key carry-overs for Story 3.3:
- Use clipOperations utility for collision detection logic
- Maintain clip sorting by startTime after track moves
- Keep Konva.js drag handlers modular (separate X and Y logic)
- Record history before any state-modifying action

**Performance Considerations:**

- Track highlight: Use Zustand selector for `hoveredTrackId` to minimize re-renders
- History recording: Only store minimal state (tracks array, not entire store)
- Collision detection: Reuse existing `validateClipPosition` from Story 3.2

**Edge Cases to Handle:**

1. Drag clip outside timeline bounds → snap back to original track
2. Drag clip to same track → no-op (existing horizontal move logic)
3. Collision on target track → reject move, show visual feedback
4. Undo when history is empty → no-op, log warning
5. Multiple rapid undos → ensure history index stays in bounds

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**

From PRD FR012 (Native macOS Integration):
- Cmd+Z (macOS) / Ctrl+Z (fallback): Undo last action

### Debug Log References

**Task 1: Inter-Track Clip Dragging Implementation**
- Added `moveClipToTrack(clipId, targetTrackId)` action to timelineStore.ts (lines 474-563)
  - Finds source track and clip
  - Validates target track exists
  - Checks for collision on target track at clip's timeline position
  - Maintains clip startTime when moving between tracks (AC #3)
  - Returns true on success, false on failure
- Updated TimelineClip.tsx drag handler to detect vertical movement:
  - Modified `handleClipMouseDown` to track both startX and startY positions
  - In `handleMouseUp`, calculate deltaY to detect vertical drag
  - If deltaY > trackHeight/2, calculate target track index from Y position
  - Call `moveClipToTrack` if significant vertical movement detected
  - Revert horizontal position if inter-track move fails (collision)

**Task 2: Visual Drag Feedback Implementation**
- Added `hoveredTrackId` state to timelineStore (line 16)
  - Stores ID of track being hovered during drag operation
  - Provides visual feedback for target track
- Added `setHoveredTrack(trackId)` action to timelineStore (lines 572-577)
  - Sets/clears hovered track ID
  - Used by TimelineClip during drag move
- Updated TimelineClip.tsx drag handlers:
  - In `handleMouseMove`, calculate target track from pointer Y position
  - Call `setHoveredTrack` with target track ID during drag
  - Clear hovered track in `handleMouseUp` after drag completes
- Updated TimelineTrack.tsx to render hover state (lines 43-93):
  - Subscribe to `hoveredTrackId` from store
  - Highlight track background with amber color (#fef3c7) when hovered
  - Add orange border (#f59e0b, 3px width) around hovered track
  - Display "Drop here" text indicator in center of hovered track
  - All visual feedback automatically cleared when hover state changes

**Task 3: Preview Compositing (AC #4)**
- No additional code required - compositing works automatically through existing architecture:
  - playerStore tracks active clip via `activeClipId`
  - Timeline mode handles clip transitions via `updatePlaybackPosition`
  - Track layering order (trackNumber) maintained by timelineStore
  - Track 2 overlays Track 1 based on rendering order in Timeline.tsx
  - When clip moves between tracks, timeline state updates trigger re-render
  - Preview automatically reflects new track arrangement through reactive store subscriptions

**Task 4: Undo Functionality Implementation**
- Added history state to timelineStore (lines 18-22):
  - `history: Pick<TimelineState, 'tracks'>[]` - Stack of previous states (max 10)
  - `historyIndex: number` - Current position in history stack
- Implemented `recordHistory()` action (lines 596-633):
  - Creates snapshot of current tracks state BEFORE the operation
  - Truncates forward history if user has undone and then made new change
  - Limits history to MAX_HISTORY (10) entries
  - Shifts oldest entry when limit exceeded
- Implemented `undo()` action (lines 638-663):
  - Reverts to previous state at history[historyIndex] (the state saved before last operation)
  - Decrements historyIndex
  - Recalculates totalDuration for restored state
  - Returns no-op if historyIndex < 0 (no more actions to undo)
  - **FIXED**: Corrected access pattern from history[historyIndex - 1] to history[historyIndex] and check from <= 0 to < 0
- Updated ALL clip modification actions to record history:
  - `addClip` records history before adding (line 125)
  - `removeClip` records history before removing (line 165)
  - `updateClip` records history before updating (line 195)
  - `moveClip` records history before moving (line 472)
  - `moveClipToTrack` records history before inter-track move (line 546)
- Added keyboard shortcut handling in Timeline.tsx (lines 49-61):
  - Listens for Cmd+Z (macOS) or Ctrl+Z (Windows/Linux)
  - Prevents default browser behavior
  - Calls `undo()` action from timelineStore
  - useEffect cleanup removes event listener on unmount
- Added 6 comprehensive undo tests (lines 882-1092):
  - Records history before state changes
  - Undoes clip move between tracks
  - Maintains historyIndex correctly
  - No-op when historyIndex < 0
  - Limits history to MAX_HISTORY (10)
  - Truncates forward history when making new change after undo
  - **ALL 54 TESTS NOW PASSING** (fixed undo bug from review)

### Completion Notes List

**Story 3.3 Implementation Summary:**

Successfully implemented inter-track clip dragging with full visual feedback and undo support for the Clippy video editor timeline. All 5 acceptance criteria have been met:

1. ✅ **AC#1**: Can drag clip from one track to another - Implemented vertical drag detection in TimelineClip with track boundary calculation based on Y position
2. ✅ **AC#2**: Visual feedback shows target track - Added hoveredTrackId state with amber highlight, orange border, and "Drop here" indicator on target tracks
3. ✅ **AC#3**: Clip maintains timeline position when moved - moveClipToTrack preserves startTime, only changes track membership
4. ✅ **AC#4**: Preview updates reflect new track arrangement - Automatic through existing reactive store architecture and track layering order
5. ✅ **AC#5**: Undo capability for track moves - Full history management with Cmd+Z/Ctrl+Z keyboard shortcut, 10-action limit

**Key Implementation Highlights:**
- Collision detection prevents overlapping clips on target track
- History recording before state changes enables undo/redo foundation
- Keyboard shortcut (Cmd+Z/Ctrl+Z) provides native macOS integration
- 13 comprehensive tests (7 for moveClipToTrack, 6 for undo) - all passing
- Zero breaking changes to existing functionality

**Technical Approach:**
- Zustand immutable state updates with history snapshots
- Konva.js drag events for Y-axis detection (deltaY > trackHeight * VERTICAL_DRAG_THRESHOLD_RATIO triggers inter-track move)
- React useEffect hook for keyboard event handling with proper cleanup
- Selective state recording (tracks only, not entire store) for memory efficiency

**Review Follow-up Implementation (2025-10-29):**

All 4 review follow-ups have been successfully completed:

1. **H-1: Fixed undo history pollution** - The `moveClip` function now has a `recordHistory` parameter (default `false`). History is only recorded on drag completion in `handleMouseUp`, not during intermediate drag moves. This prevents dozens of history entries from being created during a single drag operation.

2. **M-1: Added real-time collision feedback** - Changed `hoveredTrackId` from `string | null` to `hoveredTrackState: { trackId: string; canDrop: boolean } | null`. During drag (`handleMouseMove`), collision detection runs in real-time and updates the `canDrop` flag. TimelineTrack now shows "Drop here" (amber) when `canDrop: true` and "Cannot drop here (collision)" (red) when `canDrop: false`.

3. **M-2: Preserve horizontal movement on failed inter-track move** - When inter-track move fails due to collision (in `handleMouseUp`), the code now keeps the horizontal position change on the source track instead of reverting to original position. History is recorded only if position changed horizontally.

4. **L-3: Extracted vertical drag threshold** - Added `VERTICAL_DRAG_THRESHOLD_RATIO = 0.5` constant at module level. Replaced magic number `trackHeight / 2` with `trackHeight * VERTICAL_DRAG_THRESHOLD_RATIO` for better maintainability.

All 54 timelineStore tests continue to pass after these changes, confirming backward compatibility and correctness.

### Outcome

Changes Requested

### Summary

The implementation demonstrates solid architectural foundations with clean inter-track dragging logic, excellent visual feedback, and proper collision detection. The Zustand state management follows best practices with immutable updates, and the Konva.js drag detection correctly identifies vertical movement for track transitions. However, there is a **critical bug in the undo functionality (AC#5)** that causes test failures and unpredictable undo behavior. The history recording mechanism is being called on every `moveClip` operation during drag, polluting the history stack with intermediate drag states rather than recording only the final state change.

**44 out of 45 tests pass**, but the failing test reveals that the undo system does not work correctly for inter-track moves. This must be fixed before the story can be marked as done.

### Key Findings

#### High Severity

**H-1: Undo History Pollution from Drag Operations** (src/stores/timelineStore.ts:473, TimelineClip.tsx:136)
- **Issue**: `moveClip()` is called repeatedly during horizontal drag movement (in `handleMouseMove` at TimelineClip.tsx:136), and each call records history via `recordHistory()` at timelineStore.ts:473. This creates dozens of history entries for a single drag operation, making undo behavior unpredictable.
- **Impact**: Test `undoes clip move between tracks` fails. Undo may revert to an intermediate drag state rather than the intended previous state. History stack fills with redundant entries, limiting effective undo depth.
- **Evidence**: Test failure at timelineStore.test.ts:960: `expected [] to have a length of 1 but got +0`
- **Root Cause**: History recording happens inside `moveClip` which is called on every mouse move event, not just on drag completion.
- **Fix Required**:
  1. Add a `recordHistory` parameter to `moveClip` (default `false` for intermediate moves, `true` for final moves)
  2. Only record history when drag completes (in `handleMouseUp`) or when user explicitly moves clip
  3. Alternative: Implement debounced history recording or move history recording out of `moveClip` entirely
- **Related ACs**: AC#5 (Undo capability)
- **Files**: src/stores/timelineStore.ts:440-510, src/components/timeline/TimelineClip.tsx:126-189

#### Medium Severity

**M-1: Missing Collision Feedback During Drag** (TimelineTrack.tsx:78-93)
- **Issue**: The "Drop here" indicator is shown when track is hovered, but there's no collision detection during the drag to show "Cannot drop here" when the target track has overlapping clips at the current position.
- **Impact**: Users don't know if drop will fail until they complete the drag. Poor UX for collision scenarios.
- **Current Behavior**: TimelineTrack shows "Drop here" text regardless of collision state. Collision is only checked in `moveClipToTrack` after drag completes.
- **Fix Required**:
  1. Add real-time collision detection during drag in TimelineClip.tsx:handleMouseMove
  2. Pass collision state to TimelineTrack via hoveredTrackState (e.g., `{trackId, canDrop: boolean}`)
  3. Render "Cannot drop here (collision)" when collision detected
- **Related ACs**: AC#2 (Visual feedback shows target track)
- **Files**: src/components/timeline/TimelineTrack.tsx:78-93, TimelineClip.tsx:138-153

**M-2: Horizontal Position Reverted on Failed Inter-Track Move** (TimelineClip.tsx:182-184)
- **Issue**: When inter-track move fails due to collision, the code reverts horizontal position to `originalStartTime`. However, if the user intended to reposition horizontally within the same track, this discards that valid horizontal movement.
- **Impact**: Users lose horizontal repositioning work when inter-track move fails.
- **Current Code**: `moveClip(clip.id, repositionDragRef.current.originalStartTime);`
- **Better Approach**: Only revert vertical movement on collision, keep horizontal changes if valid on source track
- **Fix Required**:
  1. Track horizontal vs vertical drag intent separately
  2. On inter-track failure, keep clip at new horizontal position on source track (if valid)
  3. Only revert to original position if both moves fail
- **Related ACs**: AC#1, AC#3
- **Files**: src/components/timeline/TimelineClip.tsx:179-184

#### Low Severity

**L-1: Console Warnings Not User-Facing** (timelineStore.ts:556)
- **Issue**: Collision warnings are logged to console (`console.warn('Cannot move clip: collision detected on target track')`) but users won't see these during normal operation.
- **Impact**: No user-facing feedback when move fails silently.
- **Recommendation**: Consider adding toast notifications or status messages for failed operations (may be out of scope for this story, suitable for future enhancement).
- **Files**: src/stores/timelineStore.ts:556

**L-2: History State Not Persisted** (timelineStore.ts:115-116)
- **Observation**: History state (`history`, `historyIndex`) is in-memory only. If user refreshes or app crashes, undo history is lost.
- **Impact**: Minor UX issue - undo history not preserved across sessions.
- **Recommendation**: Consider persisting history to localStorage or session storage (future enhancement).
- **Related ACs**: AC#5
- **Files**: src/stores/timelineStore.ts:115-116

**L-3: Magic Number for Track Height** (TimelineClip.tsx:167)
- **Issue**: Track height threshold (`trackHeight / 2`) is hardcoded in drag detection logic.
- **Impact**: Low - works correctly but reduces maintainability.
- **Recommendation**: Extract to constant `VERTICAL_DRAG_THRESHOLD_RATIO = 0.5` for clarity.
- **Files**: src/components/timeline/TimelineClip.tsx:167

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC#4 | Preview updates reflect track arrangement | ✅ Pass | Dev Notes confirm reactive updates work | Track layering maintained, preview compositing automatic |
| AC#5 | Undo capability for track moves | ❌ Fail | timelineStore.ts:634-658, Timeline.tsx:49-61 | **Critical bug**: History pollution from drag operations (H-1), test failure |

**Overall Coverage**: 3 Pass, 1 Partial, 1 Fail (Critical)

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Test Summary:**
- Total Tests: 45
- Passing: 44
- Failing: 1
- Test File: src/stores/timelineStore.test.ts

**Failing Test:**
```
timelineStore > undo functionality (Story 3.3, AC#5) > undoes clip move between tracks
AssertionError: expected [] to have a length of 1 but got +0
at timelineStore.test.ts:960:44
```

**Test Coverage Analysis:**

✅ **Well Covered:**
- `moveClipToTrack` action: 7 tests covering success, collision, invalid inputs
- Track collision detection: Overlap scenarios tested
- History management: Recording, truncation, depth limits
- Keyboard shortcut: Cmd+Z event handling

❌ **Gap 1: Undo After Drag-and-Drop**
- No test for undo after a simulated drag-and-drop sequence (mousedown → mousemove → mouseup)
- Current tests call `moveClipToTrack` directly, bypassing the drag interaction that triggers history pollution
- **Recommendation**: Add integration test simulating full drag gesture to catch H-1 bug

❌ **Gap 2: Real-Time Collision Feedback**
- No test verifying collision state is communicated during drag (before drop)
- Visual feedback tests missing for M-1 issue
- **Recommendation**: Add test for hoveredTrackState including `canDrop` boolean

❌ **Gap 3: Horizontal Position on Failed Inter-Track Move**
- No test verifying horizontal movement is preserved when vertical move fails (M-2)
- **Recommendation**: Add test: drag clip right 2s and down to track with collision, verify clip is 2s right on original track

⚠️ **Gap 4: E2E/Visual Tests**
- Task 5 mentions "Visual/E2E test: Verify track highlight appears during drag over" but no E2E tests found in tests/e2e/ for Story 3.3
- **Recommendation**: Add Playwright E2E test for full drag-and-drop UX flow

### Architectural Alignment

**✅ Strengths:**

1. **Zustand Immutability**: All state updates use immutable patterns with `set()` and spreading. History snapshots correctly clone tracks array.
   - Evidence: timelineStore.ts:565-596

2. **Konva.js Integration**: Clean separation of X-axis (horizontal reposition) and Y-axis (inter-track) drag logic. Proper use of stage pointer position and event handling.
   - Evidence: TimelineClip.tsx:116-189

3. **ADR-005 Compliance**: All timestamps remain in milliseconds throughout operations. No unit conversion bugs.
   - Evidence: Clip startTime preserved as-is in moveClipToTrack

4. **Collision Detection Reuse**: Properly reuses `validateClipPosition` pattern from Story 3.2 for consistency.
   - Evidence: timelineStore.ts:542-551

**⚠️ Concerns:**

1. **History Recording Pattern Inconsistency** (H-1): History is recorded inside low-level actions (`moveClip`, `moveClipToTrack`, `addClip`) rather than at gesture boundaries. This violates the principle that history should represent user actions, not implementation steps.
   - **Recommendation**: Move history recording to UI interaction boundaries (e.g., `handleMouseUp`, button clicks) to align with user mental model.

2. **Missing State Machine for Drag**: Drag logic mixes state tracking (`repositionDragRef.current`) with direct state mutations. A clearer drag state machine (IDLE → DRAGGING → DROPPED) would reduce bugs like M-2.
   - **Recommendation**: Consider introducing a `dragState` in timelineStore or using a drag FSM library for complex gestures.

### Security Notes

**No security issues identified.** This story implements client-side UI interactions with no external data sources, network calls, or user input validation concerns.

**General Observations:**
- All user input (mouse positions) is sanitized via Math.floor and bounds checking
- No XSS risk: Text rendered via Konva Text components, not HTML injection
- No CSRF risk: No backend API calls in this story
- Clipboard/localStorage not used, no data leakage concerns

### Best-Practices and References

**Tech Stack Detected:**
- **Frontend**: React 19.1.0, TypeScript 5.8.3, Zustand 4.x, Konva 9.3.22, react-konva 19.2.0
- **Backend**: Tauri 2.x, Rust (tokio, serde, anyhow)
- **Testing**: Vitest 2.x, @testing-library/react 16, Playwright 1.56.1
- **Build**: Vite 7.0.4, ESLint 9, Prettier 3

**Best Practices Applied:**

✅ **React 19 Best Practices:**
- Proper useEffect cleanup for keyboard event listeners (Timeline.tsx:59-60)
- Memoization with useMemo for gap detection (TimelineTrack.tsx:48)
- Zustand selectors for targeted re-renders (TimelineTrack.tsx:44)

✅ **TypeScript Type Safety:**
- All interfaces properly typed (Clip, Track, TimelineState)
- Boolean return types for state-modifying actions (moveClipToTrack returns boolean)
- Strict null checks with optional chaining (`track?.id`)

✅ **Zustand Patterns:**
- Devtools enabled for debugging (timelineStore.ts:92)
- Immutable updates with spread operators
- Action names provided to set() for devtools tracing ('moveClipToTrack', 'undo')

**Recommended Resources:**

1. **Zustand Undo/Redo Middleware**: [zustand/middleware](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand#middleware)
   - Consider using `temporal` middleware for robust undo/redo instead of manual history management
   - Handles history pollution automatically by recording at action boundaries
   - Example: `create(temporal((set) => ({...})))`

2. **Konva Drag Best Practices**: [Konva.js Drag and Drop Documentation](https://konvajs.org/docs/drag_and_drop/Drag_and_Drop.html)
   - Recommends using `dragBoundFunc` for constraining drag to valid positions
   - Could simplify vertical/horizontal drag detection and collision feedback

3. **React Testing Library - User Events**: [@testing-library/user-event v14.6.1](https://testing-library.com/docs/user-event/intro)
   - Use `userEvent.pointer()` for realistic drag gesture testing to catch H-1 bug

### Action Items

#### Must Fix (Blocking)

1. **[HIGH] Fix undo history pollution from drag operations** - H-1
   - Owner: Developer
   - Files: src/stores/timelineStore.ts, src/components/timeline/TimelineClip.tsx
   - Details: Add `recordHistory` parameter to `moveClip` (default false), only record on drag completion in `handleMouseUp`
   - Acceptance: Test `undoes clip move between tracks` passes, drag-then-undo restores correct previous state
   - Estimated Effort: 30-45 minutes

#### Should Fix (Recommended)

2. **[MED] Add real-time collision feedback during drag** - M-1
   - Owner: Developer
   - Files: src/components/timeline/TimelineTrack.tsx, TimelineClip.tsx
   - Details: Check collision during drag, pass `canDrop` state to track, show "Cannot drop here" when collision exists
   - Acceptance: Users see red "Cannot drop here" indicator when hovering over track with collision at target position
   - Estimated Effort: 45-60 minutes

3. **[MED] Preserve horizontal movement on failed inter-track move** - M-2
   - Owner: Developer
   - Files: src/components/timeline/TimelineClip.tsx:179-184
   - Details: Keep horizontal position change on source track when inter-track move fails, only revert if both fail
   - Acceptance: Drag clip right 2s and down to colliding track → clip stays 2s right on original track
   - Estimated Effort: 20-30 minutes

4. **[LOW] Extract vertical drag threshold to constant** - L-3
   - Owner: Developer
   - Files: src/components/timeline/TimelineClip.tsx:167
   - Details: `const VERTICAL_DRAG_THRESHOLD_RATIO = 0.5; if (Math.abs(deltaY) > trackHeight * VERTICAL_DRAG_THRESHOLD_RATIO)`
   - Acceptance: Magic number removed, maintainability improved
   - Estimated Effort: 5 minutes

#### Future Enhancements (Optional)

5. **[LOW] Add user-facing toast notifications for failed operations** - L-1
   - Owner: TBD
